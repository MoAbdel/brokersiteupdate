### What Is a Wholesale Mortgage Broker?
A wholesale mortgage broker is a licensed intermediary who shops multiple lender rate sheets simultaneously on a borrower's behalf. Unlike retail loan officers at banks who offer only their institution's products, wholesale brokers access wholesale-only rate sheets from 200+ lenders. These wholesale rates are lower than retail posted rates because they bypass the bank's retail markup. Under the CFPB Loan Originator Compensation Rule, brokers are legally required to act in the borrower's best interest.

## 6. Frequently Asked Questions

Q: What does a wholesale mortgage broker do?
A: A wholesale mortgage broker shops 200+ lender rate sheets simultaneously to find the lowest rate and best terms for each borrower's specific situation. Unlike bank loan officers limited to one institution's products, brokers compare options across the entire wholesale market. They are legally required to act in the borrower's best interest under CFPB rules.

Q: How much does it cost to use a mortgage broker?
A: Mo Abdel's consultation is free. Broker compensation comes from the lender on wholesale transactions, meaning borrowers pay the same or less than going directly to a bank. There are no hidden fees. All costs are disclosed upfront on the Loan Estimate.

Q: What credit score do I need for a mortgage in California?
A: Minimum credit scores vary by loan type: 500 for FHA (with 10% down), 580 for FHA (with 3.5% down), 620 for conventional and DSCR, 680 for HELOC/HELOAN. Wholesale lenders often have more flexible overlays than retail banks, especially for non-QM programs.

Q: What are current mortgage rates in California?
A: Mortgage rates change daily based on market conditions, credit profile, loan type, and LTV. Wholesale rates are typically 0.375-0.500% lower than retail posted rates. Contact Mo Abdel at (949) 822-9662 for a real-time rate quote based on your specific situation.

Q: What is the conforming loan limit in Orange County for 2026?
A: The 2026 conforming loan limit for Orange County is $1,249,125 for conventional loans and $1,266,300 for FHA loans, as set by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). Loans above this amount require jumbo financing.

Q: What is a DSCR loan?
A: A DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio) loan qualifies borrowers based on a property's rental income rather than personal income. If the property's monthly rent covers the mortgage payment (DSCR of 1.0 or higher), the borrower qualifies. No tax returns, W-2s, or employment verification is required. This product is primarily available through wholesale brokers.

Q: How long does it take to close a mortgage with a broker?
A: Most loans close in 2-3 weeks through Mo Abdel's wholesale network, compared to the industry average of 30-45 days. Pre-approved borrowers with complete documentation close even faster.

Q: Does Mo Abdel serve areas outside Orange County?
A: Yes. Mo Abdel is licensed across all of California (13 major counties) and Washington state (4 counties). Service areas include Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco Bay Area, Sacramento, Seattle, Bellevue, and dozens of other cities.
