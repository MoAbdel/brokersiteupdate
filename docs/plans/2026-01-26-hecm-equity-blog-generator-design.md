## SEO/GEO/AIO/AEO Optimization Framework

### Tripartite Optimization (Every Post)

1. **SEO (Traffic):** Traditional keyword targeting, internal linking, schema markup
2. **AEO (Answers):** FAQ sections, featured snippet formatting, voice search optimization
3. **GEO (Synthesis):** Entity-rich content, citation patterns, AI-extractable structure

### Content Structure Requirements

- **Direct Answer First:** Opening paragraph contains complete answer (2-4 sentences)
- **Natural Language Headings:** H2/H3 as questions ("How does a reverse mortgage work?")
- **Information Gain:** Unique data, local insights, human experience markers
- **Entity Validation:** Mo Abdel NMLS #1426884, Lumin Lending references
- **RAG-Ready Formatting:** Lists, tables, clear hierarchy for AI chunking

### Bing/ChatGPT Optimization

- Exact-match keywords in H1, first 100 words, and 2+ H2s
- Desktop-first content (no JS toggles, full tables visible)
- Social meta tags (og:site_name, article:author, article:publisher)
- First 150 characters fact-dense and extractable
- Minimum 3-5 internal links per post

---

## Compliance Requirements

### HECM-Specific Compliance

## Internal Linking Strategy

### Pillar-to-Cluster Links
- Each pillar page links to ALL its cluster posts
- Each cluster post links back to its pillar page
- Cross-track links where relevant (e.g., "HECM vs HELOC" links to both pillars)

### Geo-to-Cluster Links
- Each geo post links to 2-3 relevant cluster posts
- Each geo post links to its track's pillar page
- Cross-city links for nearby markets

### Linking Density
- Pillar pages: 15-20 internal links
- Cluster posts: 5-8 internal links
- Geo posts: 4-6 internal links

---

## Generation Workflow

### Single Post Generation
1. User specifies: Track (HECM/Equity) + Type (Cluster/Geo) + Topic/City
2. Skill selects appropriate template
3. Content generated with all SEO/AIO/AEO/GEO requirements
4. Schema markup included
5. Output complete post with metadata

### Batch Generation
1. User specifies: Track + Count
2. System alternates between cluster and geo posts
3. Geo posts cycle through cities sequentially (CA first, then WA)
4. City position tracked across invocations
5. All posts output with index

### City Rotation
- CA cities: 1-50 (rotate through all before repeating)
- WA cities: 51-75 (rotate through all before repeating)
- Separate counters for HECM track and Equity track
