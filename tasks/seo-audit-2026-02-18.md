# GSC SEO Audit — 2026-02-18 — Results

## Phase 0: Architecture Summary

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.4.6 on Vercel (App Router)
- **Redirects**: 3 layers — vercel.json (CDN), middleware.ts (Edge), next.config.mjs (empty)
- **Sitemap**: next-sitemap with smart filtering (exclude + transform)
- **WWW enforcement**: Dual (Vercel CDN rule line 94 + middleware.ts line 30)
- **Canonical**: Solid via Next.js metadata API (`alternates.canonical`)

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: CRITICAL — Remove `/tools/:path*` blanket redirect
**File**: `vercel.json` (removed lines 237-240)
**Problem**: A catch-all redirect `"/tools/:path*" → "/calculator"` was intercepting ALL `/tools/*` requests at the CDN level, before Next.js could serve them. This broke ~500+ dynamic geo-tool pages that were properly implemented with `generateStaticParams()`.
**Impact**: Resolves ~500 of 585 "Page with redirect" GSC errors.

### Fix 2: Remove conflicting page+redirect for `/purchase-loans` and `/luxury-markets`
**File**: `vercel.json` (removed redirect rules)
**Problem**: Both `/purchase-loans` and `/luxury-markets` had page.tsx files AND 301 redirects in vercel.json. The redirect took priority, so the page content was dead code. 6+ internal links pointed to `/purchase-loans`, creating unnecessary redirect hops.
**Impact**: Pages now serve their content (200). Internal links work directly without hops.

### Fix 3: Sitemap config cleanup
**File**: `next-sitemap.config.js`
- Removed `/purchase-loans` and `/luxury-markets` from exclude list
- Added `/purchase-loans`, `/luxury-markets`, `/refinance-loans`, `/home-equity-guide`, `/self-employed-home-loans-california`, `/heloc-specialist-orange-county` to `additionalPaths`

### Fix 4: Remove SearchAction schema placeholder
**File**: `lib/seo.ts`
**Problem**: `SearchAction` schema pointed to `/blog?q={search_term_string}` which caused Google to crawl a non-existent search URL.
**Fix**: Replaced with `ReadAction` pointing to `/blog`.

### Fix 5: Fix internal links to redirect-source URLs
**Files changed** (17 total):
- `app/areas/newport-beach-mortgage-broker/page.tsx` — `/orange-county-jumbo-loans` → `/jumbo-loans-orange-county`
- `app/loan-programs/page.tsx` — `/orange-county-conventional-loans` → `/conventional-loans-orange-county`, `/orange-county-fha-loans` → `/fha-loans-orange-county`
- `app/blog/adu-financing-home-equity-california-2026/page.tsx` — `/blog/how-does-heloc-work` → `/loan-programs/heloc`
- `app/blog/home-equity-investment-property-down-payment-2026/page.tsx` — same
- `app/blog/how-to-get-wholesale-mortgage-rates-california/page.tsx` — `/blog/200-lender-advantage` → `-explained-2026`, `/blog/non-qm-loans-wholesale-broker` → `-2026`
- 12 reverse-mortgage regional pages — `/blog/reverse-mortgage-vs-heloc-seniors` → `/blog/reverse-mortgage-complete-guide-2026`

## Root Cause Analysis by GSC Category

### Phase 1: Redirect Errors (23 pages)
**Root cause**: Non-www URLs encountering double-hop redirects.
- 6 URLs are intentional redirects (blog → canonical destination) — non-www → www → destination = 2 hops. Not broken, just multi-hop.
- 17 URLs are existing pages — non-www → www → 200 = 1 hop. Not broken.
**Fix**: All redirect destinations verified to return 200. These will clear in GSC after re-crawl.

### Phase 2: Page with Redirect (585 pages)
**Root cause**:
- ~500 URLs: `/tools/:path*` blanket redirect catching all tool pages → **FIXED** (Fix 1)
- ~40 URLs: Intentional blog slug redirects (old → new) → Already excluded from sitemap
- ~5 URLs: `/purchase-loans`, `/luxury-markets` redirect conflicts → **FIXED** (Fix 2)
- ~40 URLs: www/non-www, http/https variants → Correct behavior, not in sitemap

### Phase 3: Not Found 404 (216 pages)
**Root cause**: Mostly stale GSC data from past crawls. Verified:
- All `/loan-programs/*` pages exist as page.tsx files
- All `/areas/*` pages exist (irvine, mission-viejo, newport-beach, etc.)
- All `/programs/*` already redirect to `/loan-programs/*`
- All top-level pages (`/cookie-policy`, `/contact-*`, `/about-*`) exist
- `/manifest.json` exists in `public/`
- `/$` already redirects to `/`
- `/search` already redirects to `/`
**Fix**: No code changes needed. Will clear after Google re-crawls.

### Phase 4: Crawled Not Indexed (24 pages)
**Root cause**: Mixed — system files + thin tool pages + duplicate pages.
- System files (sitemap.xml, robots.txt, manifest.json, favicon, llms.txt): Not content pages, shouldn't be indexed. `llms.txt` already has noindex header.
- Tool pages (7 URLs): Were being REDIRECTED (not thin) due to `/tools/:path*` → **FIXED** (Fix 1). Will now serve 200 with real content.
- Blog posts (3 URLs): May have thin content or be orphaned. Recommend internal linking and content expansion.
- Legacy pages: `/purchase-loans`, `/luxury-markets` → **FIXED** (Fix 2, now serve 200)

## Remaining Recommendations

1. **Resubmit sitemap in GSC** after deployment to trigger re-crawl
2. **Request re-indexing** for the 23 redirect-error URLs (www versions)
3. **Expand thin blog content** for 3 "crawled not indexed" posts: `foreign-national-mortgage-loans-2026`, `cash-out-refinance-vs-personal-loan-2026`, `interest-only-mortgage-loans-2026`
4. **Monitor GSC** for 2-4 weeks — most stale 404s and redirect errors should self-resolve
