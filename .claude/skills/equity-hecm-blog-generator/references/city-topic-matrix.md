# City/Topic Rotation Matrix for Geo Differentiation

## Purpose

Each geo/city/zip page must have a unique topic angle AND hyper-local data to avoid duplicate content penalties and provide genuine value. This matrix assigns specific angles to each city based on their demographic and market characteristics.

## Hub Architecture Note

As of February 2026, individual city pages have been replaced by **regional hub posts** that group 5-10 cities together. Each city still needs a unique angle from this matrix, but the angles are now applied within H2 sections of hub posts rather than as standalone page themes.

**How to use this matrix with hub posts:**
1. Look up the hub ID in `regional-hub-map.md`
2. Find all cities assigned to that hub
3. Each city's section in the hub post uses its assigned angle from this matrix
4. No two cities within the same hub should share the same primary angle
5. City sections must be 250-350 words of unique content based on the assigned angle

## Hyper-Local Data Requirements

Each geo page MUST include these unique data points:

### Market Data (Required)
```
□ Median home value for specific city/zip (source + date)
□ Year-over-year price change percentage
□ Average days on market
□ Inventory levels (if available)
```

### Demographic Context (Required)
```
□ Primary borrower profile for area
□ Dominant employment sectors
□ Average household income range
□ Homeownership rate vs. rent
```

### Neighborhood Breakdown (Required)
```
□ 3-5 specific neighborhoods within city
□ Price tiers by neighborhood
□ Which neighborhoods favor which loan products
□ School district impact on values (where relevant)
```

### Loan-Specific Relevance (Required)
```
□ Average loan amount for area
□ Common loan types used in market
□ Typical equity position of homeowners
□ Jumbo threshold relevance
```

## Content Differentiation Strategy

### For Cities with Same Topic Angle

When two cities share a primary angle (e.g., both tech-focused), differentiate by:

1. **Employer-Specific Content** — Different companies, different income structures
2. **Neighborhood Depth** — Different neighborhoods, different price points
3. **Scenario Variations** — Different borrower situations
4. **Market Timing** — Different market conditions

### Unique Content Minimum

Each geo page must have **800-1,000 words of truly unique content** including:
- City-specific market analysis (200-300 words)
- Neighborhood breakdown (200-300 words)
- Local borrower scenarios (200-250 words)
- Area-specific considerations (150-200 words)

## Topic Angle Integration

### How to Apply Topic Angles

**Example: Newport Beach (Jumbo/Luxury Focus)**

Instead of generic HELOC content:
```
❌ Generic: "A HELOC lets you access home equity..."

✓ Angled: "For Newport Beach homeowners with properties valued above the
$1,149,825 conforming limit, a jumbo HELOC provides flexible access to
substantial equity. In Corona del Mar and Balboa Island, where median
home values exceed $3 million, a well-structured HELOC can unlock
$500,000+ in renovation capital or investment funds..."
```

**Example: Costa Mesa (Self-Employed Focus)**

Instead of generic cash-out content:
```
❌ Generic: "Cash-out refinancing replaces your mortgage..."

✓ Angled: "Costa Mesa's thriving restaurant and retail scene along 17th
Street and the South Coast Metro area means many homeowners earn income
that traditional lenders struggle to document. As a wholesale broker with
access to bank statement loan programs, Mo Abdel helps Costa Mesa business
owners qualify using 12-24 months of deposits rather than tax returns..."
```

## Zip Code Differentiation

For zip-level pages within the same city:

| Zip | City | Micro-Angle |
|-----|------|-------------|
| 92657 | Laguna Niguel | Family communities, planned developments |
| 92660 | Newport Beach | Harbor area, boat owners, waterfront |
| 92661 | Newport Beach | Balboa Island, vacation property considerations |
| 92662 | Newport Beach | Lido Isle, ultra-luxury, estate financing |
| 92663 | Newport Beach | Newport Coast, gated communities, privacy |

## Quality Gate: Geo Differentiation

Before outputting a geo page, verify:

```
□ Topic angle from matrix applied throughout
□ City-specific median home value included
□ 3-5 specific neighborhoods mentioned by name
□ Local borrower profile matches angle
□ 800+ words unique to this city (not templated)
□ Scenarios reflect local market conditions
□ Internal links to nearby cities included
□ LocalBusiness schema with correct location
```

## CRITICAL: Duplicate Content Prevention (Added Feb 2026)

**Background:** In Feb 2026, 32 geo pages were marked "Crawled - not indexed" by Google due to near-duplicate content. The pages had ~85% identical content with only city names changed. This section adds MANDATORY blocking rules.

### HARD BLOCK CONDITIONS

**DO NOT generate a geo page if ANY of these are true:**

1. **City not in topic matrix** - If the city is not listed above, STOP and add it to the matrix first with a unique angle
2. **Same primary angle as adjacent city** - If two cities within 10 miles share the same primary angle, one must be changed
3. **No unique neighborhoods identified** - If you cannot name 4+ specific neighborhoods unique to this city, consider consolidating into a regional hub
4. **Template-only content** - If >60% of content would be identical to another city page, BLOCK

### Similarity Check Process

Before generating, mentally compare your planned content to the nearest similar city:

```
COMPARE TO NEAREST SIMILAR CITY:
□ Different H1 angle? (not just city name swap)
□ Different opening paragraph focus?
□ At least 3 different H2 sections?
□ Different borrower scenario?
□ Different FAQ questions (not just city name)?
□ Different market data/statistics?

If <4 checkboxes: DO NOT GENERATE - consolidate or differentiate
```

### Consolidation Triggers

**Consolidate into a regional hub page when:**
- Multiple cities share demographics (same price tier, same employer base)
- Individual city keywords have <200 monthly search volume
- Cities are in same school district or have overlapping neighborhoods
- Cannot identify 800+ unique words for each city

**Hub Structure:**
```
/blog/reverse-mortgage-washington-eastside-2026/
├── H2: Bellevue Reverse Mortgages (tech executives)
├── H2: Kirkland Reverse Mortgages (family waterfront)
├── H2: Sammamish Reverse Mortgages (estate living)
└── H2: Smaller Eastside Communities (consolidated)
```

### Content Differentiation Requirements by Category

**HECM/Reverse Mortgage Pages:**
- Different "why seniors consider" angle per city
- Different median home value and equity calculation
- Different payout scenario example
- Different "what happens to home" scenario

**Home Equity Pages:**
- Different primary use case (renovation vs debt consolidation vs investment)
- Different product recommendation hierarchy
- Different rate comparison context
- Different monthly payment scenario

**Wholesale Zip Pages:**
- Different neighborhood within zip
- Different buyer profile (faculty vs tech vs medical)
- Different loan product emphasis
- Different lender advantage highlighted

## Usage Instructions

1. **Look up city in matrix** before generating content
2. **Apply primary angle** to all sections (hook, H2s, scenarios)
3. **Include required local data** in Data Hub section
4. **Write unique neighborhood content** for that specific city
5. **Tailor borrower scenarios** to the assigned profile
6. **Verify differentiation** against similar cities before output
