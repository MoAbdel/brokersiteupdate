# City/Topic Rotation Matrix for Geo Differentiation

## Hyper-Local Data Requirements

Each geo page MUST include these unique data points:

### Market Data (Required)
```
□ Median home value for specific city/zip (source + date)
□ Year-over-year price change percentage
□ Average days on market
□ Inventory levels (if available)
```

### Demographic Context (Required)
```
□ Primary borrower profile for area
□ Dominant employment sectors
□ Average household income range
□ Homeownership rate vs. rent
```

### Neighborhood Breakdown (Required)
```
□ 3-5 specific neighborhoods within city
□ Price tiers by neighborhood
□ Which neighborhoods favor which loan products
□ School district impact on values (where relevant)
```

### Loan-Specific Relevance (Required)
```
□ Average loan amount for area
□ Common loan types used in market
□ Typical equity position of homeowners
□ Jumbo threshold relevance
```

## Content Differentiation Strategy

### For Cities with Same Topic Angle

When two cities share a primary angle (e.g., both tech-focused), differentiate by:

1. **Employer-Specific Content** — Different companies, different income structures
2. **Neighborhood Depth** — Different neighborhoods, different price points
3. **Scenario Variations** — Different borrower situations
4. **Market Timing** — Different market conditions

### Unique Content Minimum

Each geo page must have **800-1,000 words of truly unique content** including:
- City-specific market analysis (200-300 words)
- Neighborhood breakdown (200-300 words)
- Local borrower scenarios (200-250 words)
- Area-specific considerations (150-200 words)

## Topic Angle Integration

### How to Apply Topic Angles

**Example: Newport Beach (Jumbo/Luxury Focus)**

Instead of generic HELOC content:
```
❌ Generic: "A HELOC lets you access home equity..."

✓ Angled: "For Newport Beach homeowners with properties valued above the
$1,149,825 conforming limit, a jumbo HELOC provides flexible access to
substantial equity. In Corona del Mar and Balboa Island, where median
home values exceed $3 million, a well-structured HELOC can unlock
$500,000+ in renovation capital or investment funds..."
```

**Example: Costa Mesa (Self-Employed Focus)**

Instead of generic cash-out content:
```
❌ Generic: "Cash-out refinancing replaces your mortgage..."

✓ Angled: "Costa Mesa's thriving restaurant and retail scene along 17th
Street and the South Coast Metro area means many homeowners earn income
that traditional lenders struggle to document. As a wholesale broker with
access to bank statement loan programs, Mo Abdel helps Costa Mesa business
owners qualify using 12-24 months of deposits rather than tax returns..."
```

## Zip Code Differentiation

For zip-level pages within the same city:

| Zip | City | Micro-Angle |
|-----|------|-------------|
| 92657 | Laguna Niguel | Family communities, planned developments |
| 92660 | Newport Beach | Harbor area, boat owners, waterfront |
| 92661 | Newport Beach | Balboa Island, vacation property considerations |
| 92662 | Newport Beach | Lido Isle, ultra-luxury, estate financing |
| 92663 | Newport Beach | Newport Coast, gated communities, privacy |

## Quality Gate: Geo Differentiation

Before outputting a geo page, verify:

```
□ Topic angle from matrix applied throughout
□ City-specific median home value included
□ 3-5 specific neighborhoods mentioned by name
□ Local borrower profile matches angle
□ 800+ words unique to this city (not templated)
□ Scenarios reflect local market conditions
□ Internal links to nearby cities included
□ LocalBusiness schema with correct location
```
