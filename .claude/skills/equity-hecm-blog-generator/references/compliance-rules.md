# Compliance Rules

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Compliance Gate

**Every blog post MUST pass ALL compliance items before output. Non-compliant content cannot be published.**

---

## 1. Prohibited Content (NEVER Include)

### A. Interest Rate Restrictions
**NEVER mention specific interest rate percentages in any blog post.**

| Prohibited | Safe Alternative |
|------------|-----------------|
| "rates as low as 6.5%" | "competitive rates" |
| "HECM rates around 7%" | "current market rates" |
| "APR between 6-7%" | "favorable terms" |
| "0.5% lower than banks" | "wholesale pricing advantage" |
| "rates were 3% in 2021" | "historically low rate environment" |
| "rates may drop to 5.5%" | "potential rate improvements" |

### B. Savings & Payment Claims
**NEVER claim specific dollar amounts for savings or payments.**

| Prohibited | Safe Alternative |
|------------|-----------------|
| "save $500/month" | "potential monthly savings" |
| "save $50,000 over loan life" | "significant long-term savings" |
| "payments as low as $2,500" | "payment options to fit your budget" |
| "access $300,000 in equity" | "access a portion of your equity" |

### C. Guarantee & Superlative Language
| Prohibited | Safe Alternative |
|------------|-----------------|
| "guaranteed approval" | "flexible qualification options" |
| "lowest rates" | "competitive rates" |
| "best rates in town" | "among the best options available" |
| "close in 15 days guaranteed" | "streamlined closing process" |
| "no credit check" | "flexible credit requirements" |

### D. Misleading Terms
| Prohibited | Safe Alternative |
|------------|-----------------|
| "free appraisal" | "appraisal may be included" |
| "no closing costs" | "closing cost options available" |
| "pre-approved" (when meaning pre-qualified) | "pre-qualified" |
| Government endorsement implications | Factual program descriptions only |

## 2. HECM-Specific Compliance

### A. Required Disclosures
Every HECM post MUST include:

1. **Age Requirement:** Explicitly state "62 years or older"
2. **HUD Counseling:** Mention required HUD-approved counseling
3. **Non-Recourse:** Explain borrowers/heirs won't owe more than home value
4. **Loan Balance Growth:** Explain balance increases over time
5. **Property Maintenance:** Mention ongoing maintenance/tax/insurance requirements

### B. HECM-Specific Prohibited Claims
- Cannot guarantee specific principal limit amounts
- Cannot promise specific payout amounts without qualification
- Cannot claim HECM is "tax-free" without disclaimer (consult tax advisor)
- Cannot imply government recommends or guarantees HECM

### C. HECM Safe Language Patterns
```
✅ "A reverse mortgage may allow you to access a portion of your home equity"
✅ "HECM borrowers must be 62 or older and complete HUD-approved counseling"
✅ "The loan balance increases over time as interest accrues"
✅ "HECM is FHA-insured with non-recourse protection"
✅ "Individual results vary based on age, home value, and interest rates"
```

## 7. Compliance Examples

### HECM Example - COMPLIANT
```
A reverse mortgage allows homeowners 62 and older to access home equity
without monthly mortgage payments. Before applying, you must complete
counseling with a HUD-approved counselor. The loan balance grows over
time as interest accrues, but the FHA-insured HECM program includes
non-recourse protection—meaning you or your heirs will never owe more
than the home's value. Contact a licensed loan officer for a personalized
assessment of your options.
```

### HECM Example - NON-COMPLIANT
```
❌ Get a reverse mortgage and access up to $500,000 from your home!
❌ Our rates are the lowest in Orange County at 6.99%.
❌ Guaranteed approval for all seniors over 60.
❌ No counseling needed when you work with us.
```

### Equity Example - COMPLIANT
```
A HELOC provides revolving access to your home equity, typically requiring
15-20% equity and a credit score in the mid-600s or higher. As a wholesale
broker, I access pricing from multiple lenders to help you find competitive
terms for your situation. All loans are subject to credit approval and
underwriting guidelines. Contact me for a personalized rate quote.
```

### Equity Example - NON-COMPLIANT
```
❌ Get a HELOC at 7.5% APR with payments as low as $300/month!
❌ Save $10,000 compared to bank rates.
❌ Guaranteed lowest HELOC rates in California.
❌ Free closing costs on all HELOCs.
```
