# What Is a Reverse Mortgage? Complete HECM Guide for Seniors [2026]

A reverse mortgage allows homeowners 62 and older to convert home equity into
cash without making monthly mortgage payments. The most common type—HECM (Home
Equity Conversion Mortgage)—is FHA-insured with a 2026 lending limit of $1,149,825.
Unlike traditional mortgages, the loan balance grows over time and is repaid when
the borrower sells, moves, or passes away.

# Reverse Mortgage vs HELOC for Seniors: Which Is Better in 2026?

For seniors 62+, a reverse mortgage eliminates monthly payments and provides
growing credit access, while a HELOC offers lower upfront costs with required
monthly payments. The right choice depends on your income stability, how long
you plan to stay in your home, and whether you can comfortably afford monthly
payments on a HELOC.

# How Does a Cash-Out Refinance Work? Complete Guide [2026]

A cash-out refinance replaces your existing mortgage with a new, larger loan—
giving you the difference in cash. In 2026, most lenders require at least 20%
equity remaining after the cash-out, a credit score of 620+, and a debt-to-income
ratio below 43%. This option works best when you need a large lump sum and can
benefit from today's interest rate environment.

# How Does a HELOC Work? Home Equity Line of Credit Explained [2026]

A HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit) provides revolving access to your home
equity—similar to a credit card secured by your house. In 2026, most HELOCs
have a 10-year draw period with interest-only payments, followed by a 20-year
repayment period. Variable rates typically run 1-2 percentage points above
prime rate, and you only pay interest on what you borrow.

# HELOC vs Home Equity Loan: Which Is Right for You? [2026]

A HELOC offers flexible, revolving credit with variable rates, while a home
equity loan (HELOAN) provides a fixed lump sum with predictable fixed payments.
Choose a HELOC for ongoing or uncertain expenses; choose a HELOAN when you know
exactly how much you need and want payment stability. Both require 15-20% equity
and use your home as collateral.

## Key Differences at a Glance

[Comparison table]

| Feature | HELOC | Home Equity Loan |
|---------|-------|------------------|
| Rate Type | Variable | Fixed |
| Disbursement | As needed | Lump sum |
| Payment Structure | Interest-only (draw period) | Principal + interest |
| Best For | Flexible/ongoing needs | One-time fixed expense |
| Rate Level | Lower initial | Higher but stable |
