        <h2 id="what-is">What Is a Bank Statement Loan?</h2>

        <p>
          A bank statement loan is a type of non-QM (non-qualified mortgage) that uses bank deposits to verify income rather than traditional documentation like W-2s or tax returns. Lenders analyze 12-24 months of bank statements to calculate average monthly income based on deposit patterns.
        </p>

        <h3>The Problem Bank Statement Loans Solve</h3>

        <p>
          Traditional mortgage underwriting requires tax returns to verify income. For self-employed borrowers, this creates a fundamental problem:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Business deductions reduce taxable income:</strong> Home office, vehicles, meals, travel, equipment</li>
          <li><strong>Depreciation further decreases reported income:</strong> Real estate, equipment, vehicles</li>
          <li><strong>Pass-through entity treatment:</strong> S-Corp, partnership distributions not reflected as &quot;income&quot;</li>
          <li><strong>Tax strategy conflicts with mortgage qualification:</strong> Good tax planning = lower qualifying income</li>
        </ul>

        <div className="bg-slate-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-6 border border-slate-200">
          <h4 className="font-bold text-green-900 mt-0">Real Example</h4>
          <p className="mb-0">
            A California business owner deposits $35,000/month into their account but reports $150,000 annually on tax returns after deductions. Tax return qualification: $150,000/year. Bank statement qualification: $294,000/year (after 30% expense factor). This difference can mean qualifying for a $1.2M home versus a $600K home.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="why-wholesale">Why Wholesale Brokers Excel at Bank Statement Loans</h2>

        <p>
          Bank statement loans are not offered by most retail banks—they exist primarily in the wholesale channel. Here&apos;s why working with a wholesale broker provides significant advantages:
        </p>

        <h3>Access to 30+ Bank Statement Lenders</h3>

        <p>
          Each wholesale bank statement lender has unique guidelines:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Different expense factors:</strong> Ranging from 25% to 50%</li>
          <li><strong>Varying statement requirements:</strong> 12 vs 24 months</li>
          <li><strong>Different calculation methods:</strong> Average deposits, trending, seasonal adjustments</li>
          <li><strong>Credit score tiers:</strong> 580-740+ minimum requirements</li>
          <li><strong>Maximum loan amounts:</strong> $1M to $5M+</li>
          <li><strong>Property type flexibility:</strong> Primary, second home, investment</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Rate Competition Among Lenders</h3>

        <p>
          With 30+ lenders competing, wholesale brokers can secure rates 0.25-0.75% lower than borrowers would find on their own. On a $750,000 loan, this saves $15,000-45,000 over the loan term.
        </p>

        <h3>Expert Matching</h3>

        <p>
          Experienced wholesale brokers analyze your specific deposit pattern and business type to match you with lenders whose calculation methods maximize your qualifying income.
        </p>

        <h2 id="how-income-calculated">How Income Is Calculated</h2>

        <p>
          Bank statement income calculation follows a specific methodology:
        </p>

        <h3>Step 1: Calculate Average Monthly Deposits</h3>

        <p>
          Lenders total all eligible deposits over 12 or 24 months and divide by the number of months. Transfers between accounts and non-recurring deposits (sale of assets, loans) are typically excluded.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 2: Apply Expense Factor</h3>

        <p>
          An expense factor is deducted to account for business expenses:
        </p>

        <div className="overflow-x-auto my-6">
          <table className="min-w-full">
            <thead>

              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 3: Calculate Annual Income</h3>

        <p>
          Monthly income after expenses is multiplied by 12 to determine annual qualifying income. This income is then used for DTI (debt-to-income) calculations.
        </p>

        <h3>Wholesale Broker Advantage: Expense Factor Optimization</h3>

        <p>
          Different lenders apply different expense factors to the same business type. A wholesale broker knows which lenders use lower factors, directly increasing your qualifying income.
        </p>

          <ul className="mb-0">

            <li><strong>Lender B (50% expense):</strong> $40,000 x 50% = $20,000/mo = $240,000/year</li>
            <li><strong>Difference:</strong> $72,000 more annual qualifying income with Lender A</li>

          <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-0">What is a bank statement loan?</h3>
            <p className="mb-0">
              A bank statement loan qualifies borrowers using 12-24 months of bank deposits instead of tax returns. Income is calculated from deposit averages, making these loans ideal for self-employed borrowers whose tax returns understate their actual income due to business write-offs.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-0">Why do wholesale brokers offer better bank statement loan options?</h3>
            <p className="mb-0">
              Wholesale brokers access 30+ bank statement lenders, each with different calculation methods, expense factors, and guidelines. This variety means brokers can match borrowers with the lender offering the best rate and highest qualifying income for their specific deposit pattern.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-0">What credit score do I need for a bank statement loan?</h3>
            <p className="mb-0">
              Minimum credit scores for bank statement loans typically range from 620-680 depending on the lender. Higher scores receive better rates. Some wholesale lenders offer programs down to 580 with compensating factors.
            </p>

          <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-0">How much can I borrow with a bank statement loan?</h3>
            <p className="mb-0">
              Bank statement loan amounts range from $100,000 to $3 million or more through wholesale channels. California&apos;s high-cost markets support larger loan amounts, and some specialty lenders offer amounts up to $5 million for well-qualified borrowers.

          <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-0">What is the expense factor on bank statement loans?</h3>
            <p className="mb-0">
              The expense factor is the percentage deducted from gross deposits to account for business expenses. Factors range from 25-50% depending on business type. A lower expense factor means higher qualifying income. Wholesale brokers access lenders with varying factors to maximize borrower qualification.

          <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">

            <p className="mb-0">
              Both personal and business bank statements are accepted for qualification. Business accounts are common for LLCs and S-Corps. Personal accounts work for sole proprietors. Some lenders allow combining both for maximum qualifying income.
