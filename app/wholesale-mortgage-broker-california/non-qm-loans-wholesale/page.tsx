        <h2 id="what-is-non-qm">What Is a Non-QM Loan?</h2>

        <p>
          Non-QM stands for &quot;non-qualified mortgage&quot;—a loan that doesn&apos;t meet the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau&apos;s definition of a Qualified Mortgage (QM). This isn&apos;t a negative designation; it simply means the loan uses alternative underwriting methods.
        </p>

        <h3>Qualified Mortgage (QM) Requirements</h3>

        <p>
          To be a QM, a loan must meet strict criteria:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Full income documentation:</strong> Tax returns, W-2s, pay stubs</li>
          <li><strong>Debt-to-income ratio:</strong> Generally 43% or less</li>
          <li><strong>Loan terms:</strong> 30 years or less, fully amortizing</li>
          <li><strong>Points and fees:</strong> Limited to 3% of loan amount</li>
          <li><strong>No risky features:</strong> No interest-only, negative amortization, or balloon payments</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What Makes a Loan Non-QM</h3>

        <p>
          A loan becomes non-QM when it doesn&apos;t meet one or more QM requirements:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Alternative income documentation:</strong> Bank statements instead of tax returns</li>
          <li><strong>Higher DTI ratios:</strong> Above the 43% threshold</li>
          <li><strong>Interest-only payments:</strong> Principal deferred for a period</li>
          <li><strong>Non-standard qualification:</strong> Asset-based, rental income, or no income verification</li>
          <li><strong>Recent credit events:</strong> Shorter waiting periods after bankruptcy or foreclosure</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why Non-QM Loans Exist</h3>

        <p>
          QM rules work well for W-2 employees with steady income—but millions of creditworthy Americans don&apos;t fit that profile:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Self-employed business owners</li>
          <li>Real estate investors with multiple properties</li>
          <li>Retirees living on assets</li>
          <li>Foreign nationals working in the US</li>
          <li>Borrowers rebuilding after financial hardship</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Non-QM loans serve these borrowers with tailored underwriting that accounts for their unique financial situations.
        </p>

        <h2 id="why-wholesale">Why Non-QM Lives in the Wholesale Channel</h2>

        <p>
          Non-QM loans are overwhelmingly originated through wholesale mortgage brokers, not retail banks. Here&apos;s why:
        </p>

        <h3>Banks Can&apos;t Sell Non-QM to GSEs</h3>

        <p>
          Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac only purchase Qualified Mortgages. Banks that sell loans to these government-sponsored enterprises have no incentive to originate non-QM products they can&apos;t sell.
        </p>

        <h3>Specialized Lenders Serve This Market</h3>

        <p>
          Non-QM lenders are typically specialty finance companies that:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Hold loans in portfolio or sell to private investors</li>
          <li>Specialize in specific non-QM niches</li>
          <li>Develop sophisticated underwriting for alternative documentation</li>
          <li>Accept the risk profile in exchange for higher yields</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Brokers Access Multiple Non-QM Specialists</h3>

        <p>
          Wholesale brokers work with 50+ non-QM lenders, providing:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Program variety:</strong> Different lenders specialize in different borrower types</li>
          <li><strong>Guideline variations:</strong> If one lender declines, another may approve</li>
          <li><strong>Rate competition:</strong> Multiple lenders bidding for business</li>
          <li><strong>Solution finding:</strong> Match complex scenarios with appropriate lenders</li>
        </ul>

        <div className="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-6 border border-green-200">
          <h4 className="font-bold text-green-900 mt-0">The Wholesale Non-QM Advantage</h4>
          <p className="mb-0">
            A bank has zero or one non-QM program. A wholesale broker accesses 50+ non-QM lenders with hundreds of program variations. For borrowers who don&apos;t fit the conventional box, this difference determines whether they get a mortgage at all.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="program-types">Types of Non-QM Programs</h2>

        <p>
          The non-QM category encompasses multiple distinct program types, each designed for specific borrower situations:

        <h2 id="bank-statement">Bank Statement Loans</h2>

        <p>
          Bank statement loans are the most common non-QM product, designed for self-employed borrowers whose tax returns understate income due to business deductions.
        </p>

        <h3>How Bank Statement Loans Work</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Income verification:</strong> 12-24 months of bank statements</li>
          <li><strong>Calculation:</strong> Average deposits minus expense factor</li>
          <li><strong>Expense factors:</strong> 25-50% depending on business type</li>
          <li><strong>No tax returns:</strong> Deposits prove income capacity</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Typical Requirements</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Credit score:</strong> 620-680 minimum</li>
          <li><strong>Down payment:</strong> 10-20%</li>
          <li><strong>Self-employment:</strong> 2 years (some allow 1 year)</li>
          <li><strong>Reserves:</strong> 3-12 months PITI</li>
          <li><strong>Loan amounts:</strong> Up to $3M+</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="dscr">DSCR Investment Loans</h2>

        <p>
          DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio) loans qualify investment properties based on rental income, not the borrower&apos;s personal income.
        </p>

        <h3>How DSCR Loans Work</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Qualification basis:</strong> Property&apos;s rental income vs. debt payments</li>
          <li><strong>DSCR calculation:</strong> Rent / PITIA = ratio (1.0+ typically required)</li>
          <li><strong>No income verification:</strong> No W-2s, tax returns, or employment checks</li>
          <li><strong>Business entity OK:</strong> Can close in LLC name</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Typical Requirements</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Credit score:</strong> 620-660 minimum</li>
          <li><strong>Down payment:</strong> 20-25%</li>
          <li><strong>DSCR ratio:</strong> 0.75-1.25 depending on lender</li>
          <li><strong>Property types:</strong> 1-4 units, short-term rentals, mixed-use</li>
          <li><strong>Loan amounts:</strong> Up to $2-3M</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>DSCR Example</h3>

        <div className="bg-gray-100 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">
          <ul className="space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Monthly rent:</strong> $4,500</li>
            <li><strong>PITIA (Principal, Interest, Taxes, Insurance, Association):</strong> $3,600</li>
            <li><strong>DSCR:</strong> $4,500 / $3,600 = 1.25</li>
            <li><strong>Result:</strong> Qualifies (income covers payment with 25% cushion)</li>

          Asset depletion loans qualify borrowers based on liquid assets rather than income—ideal for retirees, trust beneficiaries, and high-net-worth individuals without traditional employment income.
        </p>

        <h3>How Asset Depletion Works</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Calculation:</strong> Qualifying assets / loan term months = monthly &quot;income&quot;</li>
          <li><strong>Qualifying assets:</strong> Bank accounts, investments, retirement (discounted)</li>
          <li><strong>No employment:</strong> No job or income verification needed</li>
          <li><strong>Large balances required:</strong> Significant assets needed to qualify</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Asset Depletion Example</h3>

        <div className="bg-gray-100 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">
          <ul className="space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Liquid assets:</strong> $2,000,000</li>
            <li><strong>Down payment + closing costs:</strong> $400,000</li>
            <li><strong>Remaining assets:</strong> $1,600,000</li>
            <li><strong>Divided by 360 months:</strong> $4,444/month qualifying income</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 id="foreign-national">Foreign National Loans</h2>

        <p>
          Foreign national programs serve non-US citizens without Social Security numbers or US credit history who want to purchase US real estate.
        </p>

        <h3>Program Features</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>No SSN required:</strong> ITIN or foreign ID acceptable</li>
          <li><strong>No US credit:</strong> Foreign credit reports or alternative credit</li>
          <li><strong>Higher down payment:</strong> Typically 25-30% minimum</li>
          <li><strong>Property types:</strong> Primary residence, second home, investment</li>
          <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Passport, visa, foreign income verification</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Common Foreign National Scenarios</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>International executives relocating to California</li>
          <li>Foreign investors purchasing US real estate</li>
          <li>Visa holders (H1B, L1, E2) without sufficient US credit history</li>
          <li>Dual citizens without established US financial profiles</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="recent-credit">Recent Credit Event Programs</h2>

        <p>
          These programs offer shorter waiting periods for borrowers recovering from bankruptcy, foreclosure, short sale, or other credit events.

        <h2 id="who-benefits">Who Benefits from Non-QM Loans</h2>

        <h3>Self-Employed Business Owners</h3>
        <p>
          Tax write-offs reduce reportable income, making conventional qualification difficult. Bank statement and P&L programs solve this by using actual cash flow.
        </p>

        <h3>Real Estate Investors</h3>
        <p>
          DSCR loans let investors scale portfolios without income-qualifying each property personally. The property&apos;s income is all that matters.
        </p>

        <h3>High-Net-Worth Individuals</h3>
        <p>
          Retirees, trust beneficiaries, and those living on investments can qualify through asset depletion without needing employment income.
        </p>

        <h3>Foreign Nationals</h3>
        <p>
          International buyers and workers without US credit history access homeownership through foreign national programs.
        </p>

        <h3>Credit Recovery Borrowers</h3>
        <p>
          Those rebuilding after bankruptcy or foreclosure can purchase sooner through recent credit event programs with shorter waiting periods.

          <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-0">What is a non-QM loan?</h3>
            <p className="mb-0">
              A non-QM (non-qualified mortgage) loan doesn&apos;t meet the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau&apos;s &quot;Qualified Mortgage&quot; standards for conventional sale to Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac. These loans offer flexible guidelines for borrowers who don&apos;t fit traditional lending boxes—self-employed, investors, foreign nationals, and those with recent credit events.

          </div>

          <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-0">Why do wholesale brokers have better non-QM options?</h3>
            <p className="mb-0">
              Wholesale brokers access 50+ non-QM lenders, each with unique programs and guidelines. Banks typically don&apos;t offer non-QM products at all. This wholesale access means brokers can find solutions for complex scenarios that banks simply cannot accommodate.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-0">Are non-QM loans safe?</h3>
            <p className="mb-0">
              Yes. Non-QM loans are legitimate, regulated mortgage products—just with different underwriting standards than conventional loans. They must still comply with federal lending laws. The &quot;non-QM&quot; designation simply means they&apos;re held in portfolio or sold to private investors rather than government-sponsored enterprises.

          </div>

          <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-0">What types of non-QM loans are available?</h3>
            <p className="mb-0">
              Major non-QM categories include: bank statement loans (self-employed income), DSCR loans (investment properties), asset depletion (qualify on savings), foreign national programs (non-US citizens), recent credit event programs (post-bankruptcy/foreclosure), and interest-only loans (payment flexibility).
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-0">What credit score do I need for a non-QM loan?</h3>
            <p className="mb-0">
              Non-QM credit requirements vary by program and lender. Bank statement loans typically require 620-680 minimum. DSCR loans start at 620-660. Some lenders offer programs for scores as low as 580 with compensating factors like larger down payments.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-0">Are non-QM loan rates higher?</h3>
            <p className="mb-0">
              Non-QM rates are typically 0.5-2% higher than conventional rates, depending on the program and risk factors. However, for borrowers who cannot qualify conventionally, non-QM loans provide mortgage access that wouldn&apos;t otherwise exist. The rate premium reflects the flexible guidelines.
