                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3>How do Aliso Viejo HOA fees affect my mortgage qualification?</h3>
                <p>
                    HOA fees are included in your debt-to-income ratio calculation. Combined master and sub-association fees must be factored into your maximum purchase price. Your wholesale broker will help you understand how these fees impact your buying power.
                </p>

                <h3>Are Aliso Viejo condos FHA-approved?</h3>
                <p>
                    Many Aliso Viejo condo communities have FHA approval, though status changes over time. Your broker can verify current approval status and identify FHA-eligible properties that meet your criteria. Some communities may require spot approvals.
                </p>

                <h3>What credit score do I need for an Aliso Viejo mortgage?</h3>
                <p>
                    Minimum credit scores vary by program: FHA typically requires 580+, conventional loans 620+, and jumbo loans often 680+. Higher scores qualify for better pricing. Contact us for guidance based on your specific situation.
                </p>

                <h3>How do Mello-Roos taxes affect my loan qualification?</h3>
                <p>
                    Mello-Roos assessments are included in your housing expense calculation, reducing your maximum loan amount compared to properties without these assessments. Understanding the specific Mello-Roos for your target property is essential for accurate budgeting.
                </p>

                <h3>Can I buy in Aliso Viejo with a small down payment?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes. FHA loans require just 3.5% down, conventional loans offer 3% down options, and VA loans provide zero down for eligible veterans. Aliso Viejo's condo inventory makes these programs particularly accessible for first-time buyers.
                </p>

                <h3>How long does it take to close on an Aliso Viejo condo?</h3>
                <p>
                    Condo purchases typically close in 30-45 days, with HOA document review adding potential time. Wholesale brokers with established lender relationships often expedite the HOA certification process compared to retail banks.
                </p>
