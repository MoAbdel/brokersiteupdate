        <p>
          Capistrano Beach&apos;s compact size and limited inventory create a competitive market where desirable properties move quickly. The gap between the conforming loan limit ($1,149,825) and median prices ($1.8M) means nearly every purchase requires jumbo financing expertise that wholesale brokers provide.
        </p>

        <h3>The Capistrano Beach Buyer Profile</h3>
        <p>
          Capistrano Beach attracts a mix of surfers, families, retirees, and second-home buyers seeking authentic California beach living. Unlike the more corporate feel of northern Orange County, Capo Beach maintains a relaxed vibe that draws buyers looking for genuine coastal community. Many purchases are cash or significant down payment, but jumbo financing remains essential for most buyers.
