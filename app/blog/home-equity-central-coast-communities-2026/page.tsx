  const faqData = [
    {
      question: 'How much home equity can I access in San Luis Obispo?',
      answer: 'San Luis Obispo homeowners can typically access up to 75-80% of their home value minus the existing mortgage balance through HELOC, HELOAN, or cash-out refinance products. With a median value of $1 million and many Cal Poly-area properties exceeding $1.2M, qualifying homeowners access $300K-$600K+ through wholesale broker access to 200+ lenders, including specialized programs for rental property owners and university professionals with complex income.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What HELOC options exist for Pismo Beach homes valued over $1 million?',
      answer: 'Pismo Beach homes above $1 million straddle the conforming/jumbo threshold in San Luis Obispo County, where the 2026 conforming limit is $806,500. Properties above this threshold require jumbo HELOC programs. Through wholesale broker access, credit lines of $200K-$500K+ are available from specialized lenders serving the Central Coast retirement and second-home market. These programs accept retirement distribution income, pension income, and Social Security alongside traditional employment income for qualification.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use rental income from a Cal Poly student housing property to qualify for a HELOC in SLO?',
      answer: 'Yes. San Luis Obispo rental property owners near Cal Poly frequently qualify for HELOCs using documented rental income. Wholesale lenders experienced with college town rental markets count lease income at 75-100% depending on the program, adding $15K-$40K in annual qualifying income from student housing rentals. Properties with established rental histories of 12+ months receive the most favorable income treatment from qualified lenders.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I get a HELOC or cash-out refinance on my Paso Robles wine country home?',
      answer: 'If your existing first mortgage rate is below current market rates, a HELOC or HELOAN preserves your low rate while providing equity access through a second lien. If your current rate exceeds today\'s market, a cash-out refinance replaces your mortgage at a lower rate while providing equity. Paso Robles homeowners who locked rates between 2020-2022 benefit from a HELOC or HELOAN. Agricultural property owners with vineyard land should work with lenders experienced in mixed-use agricultural residential qualification.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does a HELOC take to close on the Central Coast?',
      answer: 'A HELOC on the Central Coast typically takes 3-5 weeks from application to funding. This includes property appraisal (which may require a rural-experienced appraiser for Cambria and Paso Robles acreage properties), income and asset verification, title work, and closing. Properties with agricultural components or non-standard acreage may take 4-6 weeks due to specialized appraisal requirements. Through wholesale broker pre-qualification, we identify the fastest-closing lender for your specific property type.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What credit score do I need for a HELOC in San Luis Obispo County?',
      answer: 'Most HELOC lenders serving San Luis Obispo County require minimum credit scores of 680-720 for conforming products and 700-720 for jumbo products, with the best rates available at 740+. Through wholesale broker access to 200+ lenders, competitive HELOC programs exist across a range of credit tiers, and compensating factors like low CLTV ratios, substantial liquid reserves, and stable employment history can offset credit score requirements with certain lenders.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I get a HELOC to build an ADU on my San Luis Obispo property?',
      answer: 'Yes. ADU construction is increasingly popular in San Luis Obispo, driven by California\'s streamlined ADU permitting and intense rental demand from Cal Poly students and university employees. A $150,000-$350,000 HELOC finances ADU construction that adds $200,000-$400,000 in property value and generates $1,800-$2,800 monthly rental income in the SLO market. Cal Poly enrollment of 22,000+ students creates consistent year-round rental demand that supports ADU investment returns.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is HELOC interest tax deductible on a Central Coast home?',
      answer: 'HELOC interest is potentially deductible on your federal taxes when funds are used to buy, build, or substantially improve the home securing the loan, up to the $750,000 combined mortgage interest deduction limit. California allows a similar state deduction. Interest on HELOC funds used for non-home-improvement purposes such as debt consolidation or investment is not deductible as mortgage interest. Consult your tax advisor for your specific situation.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the maximum HELOC I can get on a $1 million Pismo Beach home?',
      answer: 'On a $1 million Pismo Beach home, maximum HELOC amounts depend on your existing mortgage balance and the lender\'s maximum CLTV ratio. At 75% CLTV with a $400K existing mortgage, you access approximately $350K in HELOC credit. At 80% CLTV with the same mortgage, approximately $400K. Jumbo HELOC programs from wholesale lenders provide credit lines up to $500K+ for qualifying borrowers with strong credit and asset profiles on Pismo Beach properties.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does a wholesale broker get better HELOC rates than my bank?',
      answer: 'Your bank offers one HELOC product at one rate. A wholesale broker simultaneously compares products from 200+ lenders, creating competition for your business. This competitive dynamic consistently produces lower rates, higher credit limits, lower closing costs, and more flexible terms. For Central Coast properties near the conforming/jumbo threshold, the broker identifies whether a conforming or jumbo product delivers better overall terms for your specific equity amount and financial profile.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can self-employed artists in Cambria qualify for a HELOC?',
      answer: 'Yes. Cambria\'s artist community includes many self-employed professionals whose income verification requires specialized lending programs. Wholesale lenders offer bank statement HELOC programs that qualify borrowers based on 12-24 months of bank deposits rather than traditional W-2 or tax return income. This benefits artists, gallery owners, and freelance creatives whose tax returns show lower adjusted gross income due to legitimate business deductions. Qualifying bank statement deposit amounts of $8,000-$15,000+ monthly support HELOC approval.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Does the wine country location of my Paso Robles property affect HELOC options?',
      answer: 'Paso Robles wine country properties with vineyard acreage or agricultural components require lenders experienced with mixed-use residential agricultural properties. Some retail banks decline properties with more than 5 acres or active agricultural use. Wholesale broker access identifies lenders who serve wine country estates, including programs that accept up to 20+ acres, count documented wine revenue as qualifying income, and appraise properties using comparable sales from the Paso Robles wine corridor rather than generic rural comparables.',

              <li>Central Coast homeowners in San Luis Obispo County hold an estimated $8.4 billion in combined residential equity across SLO, Pismo Beach, Paso Robles, and Cambria &mdash; driven by 38% average appreciation since 2021 and limited housing inventory</li>
              <li>Average tappable equity per homeowner ranges from $280K in Paso Robles to $420K+ in San Luis Obispo, assuming 75% CLTV and typical mortgage balances for long-term owners</li>
              <li>San Luis Obispo County recorded 682 HELOC originations in Q3 2025, with a 22% year-over-year increase driven by Cal Poly employee housing demand, wine country estate improvements, and coastal retirement equity migration (CoreLogic)</li>

            The Central Coast corridor &mdash; San Luis Obispo, Pismo Beach, Paso Robles, and Cambria &mdash; represents one of California&apos;s most distinctive residential equity markets, where college town premiums, coastal retirement demand, wine country estate values, and artist colony desirability converge to create substantial homeowner equity positions. From Cal Poly professors with rental investment portfolios in SLO to Bay Area equity migrants settling into Pismo Beach oceanfront retirement homes, Central Coast homeowners hold equity that HELOC, HELOAN, and cash-out refinance products convert into active financial power. As a licensed mortgage broker with wholesale access to 200+ lenders, I help Central Coast homeowners navigate diverse property types &mdash; from downtown SLO walkable bungalows to 20-acre Paso Robles wine estates &mdash; to find the best equity product and rate for their specific situation.

          <p>
            Three primary products allow Central Coast homeowners to access their home equity. San Luis Obispo and Pismo Beach homeowners with properties above the $806,500 SLO County conforming limit require jumbo HELOC programs, while Paso Robles and some Cambria homeowners access conforming products. As a wholesale broker with access to 200+ lenders, I ensure Central Coast homeowners compare across the full market &mdash; including specialists in agricultural property, self-employed income, and retirement income qualification &mdash; rather than accepting a single bank&apos;s terms.

            <strong>E-E-A-T Insight from Mo Abdel, NMLS #1426884:</strong> For most Central Coast homeowners who locked first mortgage rates between 2020 and 2022, a HELOC or HELOAN as a second lien preserves your existing low rate while providing equity access. Cash-out refinance only makes financial sense when your current rate is well above today&apos;s market. The Central Coast&apos;s unique mix of self-employed artists, university professionals, retirees, and agricultural property owners requires lenders experienced with non-traditional income verification. I analyze your current mortgage terms and income profile as the first step in every equity consultation.

          <p>
            San Luis Obispo&apos;s $1 million median home value reflects the extraordinary demand premium that Cal Poly &mdash; California Polytechnic State University with 22,000+ enrolled students &mdash; creates in a geographically constrained coastal valley. SLO consistently ranks among the happiest cities in America, and its combination of university employment stability, walkable downtown dining and entertainment along Higuera Street, and access to both mountain and ocean recreation within 15 minutes creates insatiable housing demand against limited supply. The city&apos;s urban growth boundary further restricts new development, ensuring that existing homeowners benefit from sustained appreciation pressure.
          </p>
          <p>
            San Luis Obispo&apos;s equity landscape is powered by three distinct homeowner profiles. First, Cal Poly faculty and staff who purchased homes in the 2010s at $500K&ndash;$700K now hold $1M+ properties with $400K&ndash;$600K in tappable equity. University income is exceptionally stable, making these borrowers attractive to HELOC lenders despite the variable nature of sabbatical schedules and summer session compensation. Second, rental property investors who own homes in the Cal Poly student housing corridor along Foothill, California, and Broad Street generate $2,200&ndash;$3,500 monthly rental income that wholesale lenders count for HELOC qualification, increasing borrowing power by $20K&ndash;$35K annually. Third, downtown SLO professionals in healthcare at Sierra Vista Regional Medical Center, legal, and financial services enjoy the walkable lifestyle while building substantial equity. San Luis Ranch, the city&apos;s newest master-planned community, has created additional equity growth opportunities as new construction values establish higher comparable sales benchmarks.

          <h2 id="pismo-beach" className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Pismo Beach Home Equity: Coastal Retirement &amp; Bay Area Equity Migration</h2>
          <p>
            Pismo Beach at $1 million median has become one of California&apos;s most sought-after coastal retirement destinations, attracting equity-rich buyers from the San Francisco Bay Area, Silicon Valley, and Los Angeles who sell $1.5M&ndash;$3M+ homes in those markets and purchase Pismo Beach properties with substantial equity positions or outright cash. This migration pattern creates a homeowner population with extraordinarily high equity ratios &mdash; 47% of Pismo Beach homeowners hold their properties free and clear, compared to the California average of 33%. Shell Beach, the northern enclave within Pismo Beach, commands premium values from $1.2M&ndash;$2.5M for cliff-top homes with panoramic ocean views. The beachfront bluffs along Price Street and Pismo Heights feature homes from $1.1M&ndash;$1.8M. Sunset Palisades on the south end provides excellent values at $850K&ndash;$1.2M with easy beach access.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pismo Beach HELOC demand reflects its retiree and second-home demographic. First, retired homeowners accessing equity to fund living expenses, healthcare costs, or legacy gifts to children without selling their ocean-view retirement homes. Second, second-home owners from Bay Area tech and finance who purchased Pismo Beach as a weekend retreat and now seek equity for primary residence improvements or investment property down payments. Third, vacation rental operators who leverage Pismo Beach&apos;s status as a top Central Coast tourism destination to generate $40K&ndash;$80K in annual short-term rental income from beach-adjacent properties. Wholesale lenders experienced with retirement income qualification &mdash; counting pension distributions, Social Security, IRA/401K withdrawals, and investment income &mdash; are essential for the Pismo Beach market where traditional W-2 employment is the exception rather than the rule.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Borrower scenario:</strong> A retired Bay Area tech executive (age 67) in Shell Beach with a $1.8M home owned free and clear seeks a $350K HELOC for legacy gifts to three adult children for home down payments. Their income consists of $72K Social Security, $48K pension, and $85K annual IRA distributions. Their bank declines, stating insufficient employment income. Through wholesale broker access, a lender specializing in retirement income counts the full $205K annual distribution income, approving a $350K HELOC with an 80% CLTV ratio on the $1.8M property.

          <h2 id="paso-robles" className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Paso Robles Home Equity: Wine Country Estates &amp; Agricultural Property Equity</h2>
          <p>
            Paso Robles at $800K median has undergone a remarkable transformation from a quiet agricultural town into one of California&apos;s premier wine destinations, with 200+ wineries, the celebrated Tin City food and wine district, and a charming downtown square that draws visitors from across the state. This transformation has driven 44% five-year appreciation &mdash; the fastest in the Central Coast corridor &mdash; creating significant new equity positions for homeowners who purchased before the wine boom reached its current momentum. The Westside wine corridor features estate properties on 5&ndash;20+ acre parcels, many with planted vineyards or olive groves, valued at $1M&ndash;$3M+. River Oaks and the neighborhoods surrounding the downtown square offer traditional residential properties from $650K&ndash;$1.1M. The Geneseo district east of town combines ranch-style living with agricultural potential at $700K&ndash;$1.5M on larger acreage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paso Robles presents unique equity access challenges because many properties include agricultural components that conservative banks decline or undervalue. A homeowner with a 10-acre parcel containing a primary residence, a guest house, and 3 acres of planted vineyard may find that their bank appraises only the residential structure while discounting the vineyard and agricultural improvements. Wholesale lenders experienced in California wine country property valuation assess the full property including vineyard, tasting room, barn, and agricultural infrastructure at market-appropriate values. Wine industry income &mdash; including tasting room revenue, grape sales, wine club memberships, and event hosting &mdash; adds qualifying income that agricultural-aware lenders count for HELOC approval. Tin City entrepreneurs who have opened tasting rooms, restaurants, or craft beverage operations in the district&apos;s industrial-chic spaces may qualify through bank statement programs that capture their growing business revenue.

            <strong>Borrower scenario:</strong> A wine industry couple in the Westside corridor with a 12-acre estate ($1.6M) featuring 4 acres of planted Cabernet Sauvignon, a tasting room, and a primary residence seeks a $400K HELOC for tasting room expansion and guest house renovation. Their bank declines, citing the agricultural component. Through wholesale broker access, we identify a lender experienced with Central Coast wine country properties who appraises the full estate including vineyard improvements, counts $65K in annual grape sale revenue and $42K in tasting room income alongside $120K in off-farm employment, and approves the $400K HELOC at competitive terms.

          <p>
            Cambria at $900K median occupies a singular position on California&apos;s Central Coast &mdash; a village of approximately 6,000 residents nestled between Monterey pines along the rugged coastline north of San Luis Obispo, with Hearst Castle drawing 750,000 annual visitors just 7 miles to the north. Cambria&apos;s identity as an artist colony stretches back decades, with galleries, studios, and artisan workshops concentrated in the East Village along Main Street and Burton Drive. Moonstone Beach, Cambria&apos;s signature amenity, features a boardwalk trail along dramatic coastal bluffs where sea otters, elephant seals, and migrating whales are regular sights. This combination of artistic culture, natural beauty, and proximity to the Hearst Castle tourism economy creates sustained buyer demand from retirees, artists, creative professionals, and remote workers seeking an alternative to urban California living.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cambria&apos;s equity access landscape requires attention to three factors that distinguish it from conventional residential markets. First, self-employment dominates &mdash; artists, gallery owners, Etsy sellers, freelance writers, photographers, and creative consultants constitute a large share of Cambria homeowners. These borrowers need bank statement HELOC programs rather than traditional W-2 verification. Second, Cambria&apos;s water moratorium (lifted partially in recent years but still constraining new development) has created an artificially restricted supply that supports premium values and sustained appreciation for existing homes. Third, many Cambria homeowners are semi-retired or fully retired, combining modest Social Security and pension income with irregular art sales, gallery commissions, and freelance project revenue. Wholesale lenders who accept hybrid income documentation &mdash; combining retirement distributions with bank statement deposits from self-employment &mdash; are essential for Cambria&apos;s unique borrower population.

          <h2 id="eeat-narrative" className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Why Central Coast Homeowners Choose a Wholesale Broker for Home Equity Products</h2>
          <p>
            The Central Coast&apos;s homeowner population includes an unusually high concentration of non-traditional income earners: Cal Poly academics with sabbatical-adjusted salaries, wine industry professionals with agricultural revenue, self-employed artists and gallery owners, retirees with distribution-based income, and Bay Area transplants with investment portfolios as their primary income source. This income diversity requires lender expertise that most retail banks lack. A wholesale broker&apos;s role is to match each Central Coast homeowner with the lender whose qualification methodology maximizes their equity access.
          </p>

              <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-2">200+ Lender Competition</h3>
              <p>Your bank offers one HELOC product at one rate. I compare products from 200+ lenders, creating competition that consistently produces lower rates, higher credit lines, and better terms. For Central Coast properties near the conforming/jumbo threshold, even identifying the right product tier saves thousands over the life of the credit line.</p>

              <p>Gallery sales, commissioned artwork, freelance creative work, wine industry revenue, and Etsy/online marketplace income require lenders offering bank statement programs. I match Cambria artists, Paso Robles winemakers, and SLO freelancers with lenders counting their actual deposit history rather than requiring traditional W-2 documentation.</p>

            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-5 rounded-lg">
              <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Agricultural Property Specialists</h3>
              <p>Paso Robles wine estates and Central Coast acreage properties require lenders experienced with mixed-use residential agricultural valuation. Wholesale broker access identifies lenders who appraise vineyard land, tasting room improvements, and agricultural infrastructure at full market value rather than discounting them as non-residential components.</p>

            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-5 rounded-lg">
              <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Retirement Income Qualification</h3>
              <p>Pismo Beach and Cambria&apos;s large retiree populations need lenders who properly count pension distributions, Social Security, IRA withdrawals, and investment income for HELOC qualification. Conservative banks often undercount or decline retirement-income-only applications. Wholesale access identifies retirement-friendly lenders who approve based on asset depletion or distribution income methodologies.</p>

            <strong>E-E-A-T Insight from Mo Abdel, NMLS #1426884:</strong> The Central Coast is one of California&apos;s most diverse income landscapes. In a single week I help a Cal Poly professor with summer session and consulting income, a Paso Robles winemaker with grape sale revenue, a Cambria artist with gallery commission income, and a Pismo Beach retiree with pension and Social Security as their only income. No single bank serves all these profiles well. The wholesale broker model exists specifically to solve this problem: matching every unique Central Coast homeowner with the lender whose qualification rules produce the best outcome for their specific income type. One call replaces months of rejected applications at banks that don&apos;t understand Central Coast income patterns.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-green-900 mb-3">Expert Summary: Home Equity in Central Coast Communities</h2>
            <p className="text-slate-900 mb-3">
              The Central Coast corridor &mdash; San Luis Obispo, Pismo Beach, Paso Robles, and Cambria &mdash; holds an estimated $8.4 billion in combined residential equity, driven by 38&ndash;44% five-year appreciation across all four communities. With median values ranging from $800K in Paso Robles to $1M in San Luis Obispo and Pismo Beach, qualifying homeowners access $280K to $420K+ in tappable equity per property. The Central Coast&apos;s unique mix of college town premiums, coastal retirement demand, wine country estate values, and artist colony desirability creates a homeowner population with distinctively diverse income profiles.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-900 mb-3">
              Cal Poly professors with summer teaching and consulting income, Paso Robles winemakers with grape sale and tasting room revenue, Cambria artists with gallery commission and online marketplace sales, and Pismo Beach retirees with pension and distribution income all require specialized lender matching that conservative banks cannot provide. Through wholesale broker access to 200+ lenders, I match each homeowner with the lender using the most favorable qualification methodology for their specific income type, property type, and equity goals.
            </p>
