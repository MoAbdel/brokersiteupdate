                <h2>Why is Calabasas ideal for cash-out refinancing in 2026?</h2>
                <p>
                    Calabasas has established itself as one of Los Angeles County's most desirable residential communities. As a wholesale broker serving this market, I've identified several factors creating excellent cash-out opportunities:
                </p>
                <ul>

                <p>
                    A cash-out refinance replaces your current mortgage with a larger loan, providing the difference as cash at closing. For Calabasas homeowners:

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3>How much equity can I access from my Calabasas home?</h3>
                <p>
                    Cash-out refinancing typically allows access to up to 75-80% of your home's value minus your existing mortgage balance. With Calabasas median home values around $2 million and many gated community homes significantly higher, homeowners often have substantial equity available for cash-out.

                <h3>Do Calabasas HOA fees affect cash-out refinance qualification?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes, lenders include HOA fees in your debt-to-income ratio calculation. Calabasas gated communities like The Oaks and Mountain View Estates have varying HOA structures. Higher fees reduce borrowing capacity, but Calabasas homeowners typically have strong income profiles to accommodate these costs.
                </p>

                <h3>Can self-employed Calabasas residents qualify for cash-out refinancing?</h3>
                <p>
                    Absolutely. Many Calabasas homeowners are business owners and entrepreneurs. Options include traditional tax return documentation, bank statement programs using 12-24 months of deposits, asset depletion loans, and CPA-verified profit and loss statements.
                </p>

                <h3>What are the closing costs for a Calabasas cash-out refinance?</h3>
                <p>
                    Closing costs typically range from 2-3% of the loan amount and include appraisal fees, title insurance, escrow fees, and lender charges. For Calabasas jumbo loans, costs may be higher in absolute terms but represent a smaller percentage of larger loan amounts. Some lenders offer reduced-cost options.
                </p>

                <h3>How long does a Calabasas cash-out refinance take to close?</h3>
                <p>
                    Most cash-out refinances close within 30-45 days. Calabasas luxury properties may require additional time for specialized appraisals. Wholesale brokers typically process faster than retail banks due to streamlined operations and direct lender relationships.
