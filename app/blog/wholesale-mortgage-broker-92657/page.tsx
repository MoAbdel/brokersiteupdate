            Newport Coast 92657 represents Orange County&apos;s most exclusive real estate market with a <strong>$6.8 million median home price</strong>. When the 2026 conforming loan limit of $1,149,825 covers less than 17% of the typical purchase, you need a <strong>wholesale mortgage broker</strong> with access to 200+ jumbo lenders—not a bank limited to a single product menu. On a $5 million loan, our wholesale access regularly secures <strong>better rates than Wells Fargo Private Bank, First Republic, or Chase Private Client</strong> can offer.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why Newport Coast Homebuyers Choose Wholesale</h2>

        <h3>The 92657 Market Challenge</h3>
        <p>
          Newport Coast presents unique financing requirements that most banks cannot efficiently address:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ultra-luxury price points:</strong> Homes range from $3.5M to $35M+, requiring super-jumbo expertise</li>
          <li><strong>Complex buyer profiles:</strong> Business owners, executives, and investors with non-traditional income</li>
          <li><strong>Asset-heavy, income-light situations:</strong> Retirees and investors with portfolios but limited W-2 income</li>
          <li><strong>Competitive sellers:</strong> Cash offers and fast closings dominate; financing must match</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Conforming Loan Gap</h3>
        <p>
          The 2026 conforming loan limit sits at $1,149,825—adequate for most California markets but irrelevant for Newport Coast. With a $6.8M median price, the typical 92657 buyer needs a <strong>jumbo loan of $5-6 million</strong> after their down payment. Banks like Wells Fargo, First Republic, and Chase offer jumbo products, but they&apos;re competing only with themselves. A wholesale broker forces <strong>200+ lenders to compete</strong> for your business.

        <h2>Jumbo Loan Programs for Newport Coast</h2>

        <h3>Conventional Jumbo (Full Documentation)</h3>
        <p>
          For W-2 employees and documented business income with strong credit:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Loan amounts up to $10 million+</li>

        <h3>Asset Depletion Programs</h3>
        <p>
          Newport Coast attracts buyers with substantial wealth but unconventional income. Asset depletion loans solve this by calculating qualifying income from liquid assets:

          <li>Use investment accounts, retirement funds, or cash as income</li>
          <li>Ideal for retirees, trust beneficiaries, and passive investors</li>
          <li>Loan amounts up to $10 million</li>
          <li>No traditional employment required</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Bank Statement Jumbo</h3>
        <p>
          For self-employed Newport Coast residents who show expenses on tax returns:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>12-24 months of personal or business bank statements</li>
          <li>No tax return analysis required</li>
          <li>Loan amounts up to $5 million+</li>
          <li>Business owners, consultants, and entrepreneurs</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Interest-Only Jumbo</h3>
        <p>
          Cash flow optimization for sophisticated borrowers:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Interest-only payments for 5-10 years</li>
          <li>Lower initial payment, deploy capital elsewhere</li>
          <li>Available on jumbo loans up to $7 million+</li>
          <li>Requires strong compensating factors</li>
        </ul>
