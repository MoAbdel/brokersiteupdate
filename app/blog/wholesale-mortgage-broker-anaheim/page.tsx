          Anaheim's economic engine includes the Disneyland Resort, Angel Stadium, Honda Center, and the Anaheim Convention Center, all of which drive employment and housing demand. The city's diverse economy supports a substantial self-employed population—business owners, contractors, hospitality entrepreneurs, and service providers—who often benefit from bank statement loan programs that traditional banks do not offer.
        </p>

        <h3>Market Characteristics That Affect Financing</h3>

        <p>
          Several factors make wholesale broker access particularly valuable for Anaheim homebuyers:

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Price diversity:</strong> Properties range from $500,000 condos to $3 million+ estates, requiring different loan programs</li>
          <li><strong>Self-employed concentration:</strong> Strong demand for bank statement and non-QM programs</li>
          <li><strong>Investment property activity:</strong> Proximity to tourist attractions creates demand for DSCR investor loans</li>
          <li><strong>Condo inventory:</strong> Platinum Triangle and other developments require lenders experienced with HOA and condo financing</li>
          <li><strong>First-time buyer market:</strong> More accessible price points in certain areas support FHA and conventional low-down programs</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Program Access Banks Cannot Match</h3>

        <p>
          Beyond rate advantages, wholesale brokers provide access to loan programs that retail banks typically do not offer:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bank Statement Loans:</strong> Critical for Anaheim's self-employed population—business owners near the convention center, restaurant operators, contractors serving the construction industry, and hospitality entrepreneurs</li>
          <li><strong>DSCR Investor Programs:</strong> Anaheim's tourism economy creates strong rental demand; DSCR loans qualify based on property income without personal income verification</li>
          <li><strong>Multiple Jumbo Lenders:</strong> Anaheim Hills buyers access 20+ jumbo lenders with varying guidelines, not just one bank's rigid criteria</li>
          <li><strong>Condo-Specific Options:</strong> Lenders comfortable with newer Platinum Triangle developments and their HOA structures</li>
          <li><strong>Non-QM Flexibility:</strong> Asset depletion, recent credit events, foreign national programs for diverse buyer needs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="loan-programs">Loan Programs for Anaheim Homebuyers</h2>

        <h3>Conventional Loans</h3>

        <p>
          Standard conventional financing works well for much of Anaheim outside of premium Anaheim Hills:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Down payment:</strong> 3% for first-time buyers, 5-20% standard options</li>
          <li><strong>Credit requirements:</strong> 620 minimum, better rates at 740+</li>
          <li><strong>Conforming limit:</strong> Up to $1,149,825 in Orange County (2026)</li>
          <li><strong>PMI options:</strong> Monthly, single premium, or lender-paid structures</li>
          <li><strong>Wholesale advantage:</strong> Compare rates across 200+ conventional lenders</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Jumbo Loans</h3>

        <p>
          Essential for Anaheim Hills and higher-priced properties throughout Anaheim:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Loan amounts:</strong> Above $1,149,825, with super jumbo for $2M+ purchases</li>
          <li><strong>Down payment:</strong> Typically 10-20% depending on loan amount and credit</li>
          <li><strong>Credit requirements:</strong> Generally 680+ with strong reserves</li>
          <li><strong>Wholesale advantage:</strong> Access to 20+ jumbo lenders with different guidelines and pricing</li>
          <li><strong>Asset flexibility:</strong> Some programs allow higher DTI with substantial reserves</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Bank Statement Loans</h3>

        <p>
          Ideal for Anaheim's large self-employed population:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> 12 or 24 months of bank statements instead of tax returns</li>
          <li><strong>Income calculation:</strong> Based on deposits, typically using 50-100% of business deposits</li>
          <li><strong>Credit requirements:</strong> Generally 660+ minimum</li>
          <li><strong>Loan amounts:</strong> Available up to $3M+ for qualified borrowers</li>
          <li><strong>Ideal candidates:</strong> Business owners, contractors, consultants, 1099 workers, gig economy participants</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Anaheim's economy supports many self-employed individuals who benefit from bank statement programs: restaurant owners near the Packing House, contractors serving new construction, convention service providers, hospitality entrepreneurs, and small business owners throughout the city's commercial districts.
        </p>

        <h3>FHA Loans</h3>

        <p>
          Viable option for Anaheim buyers with lower down payments or credit challenges:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Down payment:</strong> 3.5% with 580+ credit score</li>
          <li><strong>Credit flexibility:</strong> More lenient than conventional guidelines</li>
          <li><strong>Loan limit:</strong> $1,149,825 in Orange County (2026)</li>
          <li><strong>Best for:</strong> First-time buyers, buyers rebuilding credit, lower down payment situations</li>
          <li><strong>Consideration:</strong> Mortgage insurance for life of loan unless refinanced</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>VA Loans</h3>

        <p>
          Outstanding option for Anaheim's veteran and active military population:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Down payment:</strong> 0% for eligible borrowers</li>
          <li><strong>PMI:</strong> None required regardless of down payment</li>
          <li><strong>Funding fee:</strong> Can be financed into loan; exempt for service-connected disability</li>
          <li><strong>Loan limit:</strong> No limit with full entitlement</li>
          <li><strong>Wholesale access:</strong> Multiple VA-approved lenders for rate comparison</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>DSCR Investor Loans</h3>

        <p>
          Popular for Anaheim investment property purchases:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Qualification:</strong> Based on property cash flow, not personal income</li>
          <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> No tax returns, W-2s, or employment verification</li>
          <li><strong>DSCR ratio:</strong> Typically 1.0-1.25 minimum (rent covers mortgage)</li>
          <li><strong>Short-term rentals:</strong> Many lenders accept projected Airbnb/VRBO income</li>
          <li><strong>Entity purchase:</strong> Can close in LLC for liability protection</li>
          <li><strong>Portfolio building:</strong> Finance multiple properties without income stacking limits</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Anaheim's proximity to Disneyland creates strong vacation rental demand, making DSCR programs particularly attractive for investors targeting the Resort District.

        <h2>The Anaheim Wholesale Mortgage Process</h2>

        <p>
          Working with a wholesale broker in Anaheim follows a clear process:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Initial Consultation:</strong> Discuss your Anaheim housing goals—are you targeting Anaheim Hills, exploring the Platinum Triangle, or looking for investment opportunities near the Resort District? Your broker assesses which programs and lenders fit your situation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Document Collection:</strong> Provide income documentation appropriate to your program—W-2s and tax returns for conventional, bank statements for self-employed, property analysis for DSCR investments.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pre-Approval:</strong> Receive pre-approval for confident house shopping. In Anaheim's competitive neighborhoods, strong pre-approval strengthens your offers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Property-Specific Analysis:</strong> Once you identify a property, your broker analyzes which lenders offer the best combination of rate, fees, and terms for that specific purchase.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lender Shopping:</strong> Your broker compares options across 200+ lenders, considering rate, closing costs, and any property-specific requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rate Lock:</strong> Lock your rate when timing aligns with your closing date and market conditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Processing and Closing:</strong> Your broker coordinates document collection, appraisal, and lender communication through successful closing.
          </li>
        </ol>
