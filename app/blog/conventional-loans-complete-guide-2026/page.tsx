                        Conventional loans are mortgages not insured by government agencies (FHA, VA, USDA), instead backed by <strong>Fannie Mae</strong> or <strong>Freddie Mac</strong>. In 2026, the conforming loan limit for Orange County is <strong>$1,249,125</strong> for single-family homes. Working with a <strong>wholesale mortgage broker</strong> provides access to conventional loan pricing that typically undercuts retail bank offerings by meaningful margins—savings that compound over the life of your loan.

                <h2>What is a conventional loan and how does it work?</h2>
                <p>
                    Conventional loans are the most common mortgage type, accounting for approximately 70% of all home loans. They follow guidelines established by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored enterprises that purchase mortgages from lenders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Key characteristics of conventional loans:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Not government-insured</strong> unlike FHA, VA, or USDA loans</li>
                    <li><strong>Conforming limits</strong> set annually by FHFA</li>
                    <li><strong>Flexible down payment options</strong> from 3% to 20%+</li>
                    <li><strong>PMI required</strong> with less than 20% down (removable)</li>
                    <li><strong>Available for</strong> primary homes, second homes, and investments</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What are the 2026 conventional loan requirements?</h2>

                <h3>Credit Score Requirements</h3>
                <p>
                    Conventional loans have tiered credit requirements affecting pricing and approval:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Minimum 620</strong> for most conventional programs</li>
                    <li><strong>680+</strong> for optimal pricing and terms</li>
                    <li><strong>740+</strong> for the best available pricing</li>
                    <li>Higher scores offset other risk factors</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Down Payment Options</h3>
                <p>
                    Conventional loans offer flexible down payment structures:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>3% down:</strong> Available for first-time buyers through Fannie Mae HomeReady or Freddie Mac Home Possible</li>
                    <li><strong>5% down:</strong> Standard conventional option for most borrowers</li>
                    <li><strong>10% down:</strong> Reduced PMI costs compared to lower down payments</li>
                    <li><strong>20%+ down:</strong> No PMI required, best pricing</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Debt-to-Income Ratio</h3>
                <p>
                    DTI measures your monthly debts against gross income:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Standard maximum:</strong> 45% DTI</li>
                    <li><strong>With compensating factors:</strong> Up to 50% DTI possible</li>
                    <li><strong>Compensating factors include:</strong> High credit scores, significant reserves, low LTV</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How do conventional loans compare to government loans?</h2>

                <h3>Conventional vs. FHA Loans</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Down payment:</strong> Conventional 3-5% vs. FHA 3.5%</li>
                    <li><strong>Mortgage insurance:</strong> Conventional PMI is removable; FHA MIP often permanent</li>
                    <li><strong>Credit flexibility:</strong> FHA more lenient on credit issues</li>
                    <li><strong>Loan limits:</strong> Same conforming limits in most areas</li>
                    <li><strong>Property standards:</strong> Conventional typically less restrictive</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Conventional vs. VA Loans</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Eligibility:</strong> VA requires military service; conventional open to all</li>
                    <li><strong>Down payment:</strong> VA offers 0% down; conventional minimum 3%</li>
                    <li><strong>Mortgage insurance:</strong> VA has no monthly MI; conventional has PMI under 20%</li>
                    <li><strong>Funding fee:</strong> VA has funding fee; conventional has no equivalent</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Understanding Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)</h2>

                <h3>When is PMI required?</h3>
                <p>
                    PMI is required on conventional loans with less than 20% down payment. It protects the lender if you default on the loan.
                </p>

                <h3>PMI cost factors</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Credit score (higher scores = lower PMI)</li>
                    <li>Down payment amount (more down = lower PMI)</li>
                    <li>Loan-to-value ratio</li>
                    <li>Property type and occupancy</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How to remove PMI</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Automatic termination:</strong> At 78% LTV based on original value</li>
                    <li><strong>Borrower request:</strong> At 80% LTV with good payment history</li>
                    <li><strong>New appraisal:</strong> If home value increased significantly</li>
                    <li><strong>Refinancing:</strong> Into new loan with 20%+ equity</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Why do wholesale brokers offer better conventional loan pricing?</h2>

                <h3>Lower overhead means lower costs</h3>
                <p>
                    Wholesale mortgage brokers operate without the expensive infrastructure of retail banks:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No branch network to maintain</li>
                    <li>Minimal advertising expenses</li>
                    <li>Streamlined operations and technology</li>
                    <li>Direct lender relationships without middlemen</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Competition among lenders benefits you</h3>
                <p>
                    Wholesale brokers submit your loan to multiple lenders, creating competition for your business. This pricing pressure typically results in better terms than a single retail bank can offer.
                </p>

                <h3>Access to specialized programs</h3>
                <p>
                    Different wholesale lenders excel in different areas:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some offer aggressive pricing for high credit scores</li>
                    <li>Others specialize in lower down payment programs</li>
                    <li>Certain lenders handle complex income documentation better</li>
                    <li>Your broker matches your profile to the optimal lender</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Conventional loan property types</h2>

                <h3>Single-Family Homes</h3>
                <p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3>What credit score do I need for a conventional loan?</h3>
                <p>
                    The minimum credit score for most conventional loans is 620, though some programs require 640+. For optimal pricing, aim for 740 or higher. Borrowers between 620-680 can qualify but may face higher costs. Individual circumstances vary—contact a licensed loan officer for personalized guidance.
                </p>

                <h3>Can I get a conventional loan with 3% down?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes. Fannie Mae's HomeReady and Freddie Mac's Home Possible programs allow 3% down for qualified borrowers. First-time buyers (no ownership in past 3 years) and those meeting income limits may qualify. Standard conventional loans require minimum 5% down.
                </p>

                <h3>How is conventional PMI different from FHA mortgage insurance?</h3>
                <p>
                    Conventional PMI can be removed once you reach 20% equity—either through payments, appreciation, or both. FHA mortgage insurance premium (MIP) typically remains for the life of the loan on purchases with less than 10% down, making conventional loans often more cost-effective long-term.
                </p>

                <h3>What are conforming loan limits for 2026?</h3>
                <p>
                    The 2026 conforming loan limit for single-family homes in most of the U.S. is $832,750. High-cost areas like Orange County can go up to $1,249,125. Loans exceeding local conforming limits require jumbo financing with different requirements.
                </p>

                <h3>Can I use gift funds for my conventional loan down payment?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes. Gift funds from family members are permitted for conventional loans. The gift must be properly documented with a gift letter stating no repayment is expected. Some programs require a minimum borrower contribution from their own funds.
                </p>

                <h3>How long does a conventional loan take to close?</h3>
                <p>
                    Most conventional loans close in 30-45 days from application. Wholesale brokers often close faster than retail banks due to streamlined operations and established lender relationships. Complex files or property issues may extend timelines.
                </p>
