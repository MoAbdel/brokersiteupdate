        <h2 id="what-are-non-qm">What Are Non-QM Loans?</h2>
        <p>
          Non-QM loans (non-qualified mortgages) are mortgage products that fall outside the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's "Qualified Mortgage" definition established under the Dodd-Frank Act. This classification has nothing to do with loan quality or borrower capability—it reflects documentation methodology and certain loan features that differ from standardized conventional guidelines.
        </p>
        <p>
          The CFPB created Qualified Mortgage standards to establish a "safe harbor" for lenders—mortgages meeting these standards receive legal protections presuming ability-to-repay requirements were met. Qualified mortgages must verify income using specific methods (typically tax returns and pay stubs), maintain debt-to-income ratios below 43% (with some exceptions), avoid certain features like interest-only periods exceeding specific durations, and meet points and fees caps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Non-QM loans exist because millions of creditworthy borrowers cannot meet these standardized requirements despite having clear ability to repay. Self-employed business owners whose tax returns show modest income due to legitimate business deductions represent a prime example. A business owner might deposit $400,000 annually into their bank account but show only $150,000 on tax returns after deductions. Conventional lending says they qualify based on $150,000; bank statement lending recognizes the $400,000 reality.
        </p>

        <h3>The Non-QM Landscape in 2026</h3>
        <p>
          The non-QM market has matured significantly since its post-2008 emergence. Modern non-QM loans feature robust underwriting standards that verify ability to repay using alternative documentation methods, strong borrower protections meeting or exceeding regulatory requirements, competitive pricing reflecting actual risk (not predatory terms), specialized programs addressing specific borrower situations, and professional servicing standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are not the problematic loans of the pre-2008 era. Non-QM lending in 2026 serves capable borrowers with legitimate financing needs that standardized conventional guidelines cannot address.

        <h2 id="why-wholesale-only">Why Banks Cannot Offer Most Non-QM Programs</h2>
        <p>
          Understanding why non-QM programs are predominantly available through wholesale brokers requires understanding how the mortgage industry operates at the institutional level.
        </p>

        <h3>The Secondary Market Reality</h3>
        <p>
          Banks originate mortgages primarily to sell them on the secondary market to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other institutional investors. This sale generates immediate capital that the bank can lend again. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac only purchase Qualified Mortgages meeting their standardized guidelines. Non-QM loans cannot be sold to these government-sponsored enterprises.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a bank to offer non-QM loans, they would need to either hold these loans on their own books (requiring significant capital allocation) or maintain relationships with private investors who purchase non-QM loans. Most banks choose neither path because their business model revolves around the GSE secondary market.
        </p>

        <h3>Risk Appetite and Specialization</h3>
        <p>
          Non-QM lending requires specialized underwriting expertise that differs from conventional loan evaluation. Bank statement income calculation, DSCR analysis, asset depletion methodology, and foreign income documentation each require specific knowledge and systems. Banks optimize for volume in standardized products, not specialized expertise in niche programs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, non-QM loans carry different risk profiles than conventional mortgages. Banks with conservative risk parameters often avoid these products entirely rather than developing the specialized risk assessment capabilities required.
        </p>

        <h3>The Wholesale Broker Solution</h3>
        <p>
          Wholesale mortgage brokers solve this market gap by maintaining relationships with 100+ non-QM specialty lenders. These lenders exist specifically to serve the non-QM market. They have private investor relationships for loan sales, specialized underwriting expertise, risk models designed for non-QM evaluation, and focused operational capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Mo Abdel explains: "When a self-employed client comes to a bank, they're often told they don't qualify based on tax return income.

        <h2 id="bank-statement-loans">Bank Statement Loans: The Self-Employed Solution</h2>
        <p>
          Bank statement loans represent the largest segment of non-QM lending, serving millions of self-employed borrowers whose tax returns understate their true income.
        </p>

        <h3>How Bank Statement Loans Work</h3>
        <p>
          Instead of using tax returns to calculate income, bank statement loans analyze 12-24 months of bank deposits. The lender reviews consistent deposit patterns, identifies and excludes non-recurring or non-income deposits, applies an expense factor (typically 50% for business accounts), and calculates average monthly income from remaining deposits.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, a business owner depositing $30,000 monthly into their business account might qualify with $15,000 monthly income after a 50% expense factor. If their tax returns showed only $8,000 monthly after deductions, the bank statement approach nearly doubles their qualifying income.
        </p>

        <h3>Bank Statement Program Variations</h3>
        <p>
          Wholesale brokers access multiple bank statement program variations from different lenders:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Personal bank statements:</strong> 12-24 months of personal account deposits</li>
          <li><strong>Business bank statements:</strong> 12-24 months of business account deposits (with expense factor)</li>
          <li><strong>Combined approach:</strong> Personal and business statements together</li>
          <li><strong>12-month programs:</strong> Shorter history requirement (often higher rates)</li>
          <li><strong>24-month programs:</strong> Longer history (typically better pricing)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="dscr-loans">DSCR Loans: Investment Property Without Personal Income Verification</h2>
        <p>
          DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio) loans revolutionized investment property financing by qualifying borrowers based on property cash flow rather than personal income.
        </p>

        <h3>Understanding DSCR</h3>
        <p>
          The debt service coverage ratio compares a property's rental income to its mortgage payment (principal, interest, taxes, insurance, and HOA). A DSCR of 1.0 means the rent exactly covers the payment. A DSCR of 1.25 means rent exceeds the payment by 25%.
        </p>
        <p>
          DSCR = Monthly Rent / Monthly PITIA
        </p>
        <p>
          Most DSCR lenders require a minimum ratio of 1.0-1.25, though some programs accept ratios below 1.0 (meaning negative cash flow) with compensating factors like larger down payment or higher credit score.
        </p>

        <h3>Why Investors Choose DSCR</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No personal income verification:</strong> W-2s, tax returns, and pay stubs are not required</li>
          <li><strong>No DTI calculation:</strong> Your personal debt-to-income ratio is not considered</li>
          <li><strong>Unlimited financed properties:</strong> Scale your portfolio without conventional limits</li>
          <li><strong>LLC or personal name:</strong> Close in entity name or personally</li>
          <li><strong>Quick qualification:</strong> Property-focused underwriting streamlines approval</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="asset-depletion">Asset Depletion Programs: Qualify Using Wealth</h2>
        <p>
          Asset depletion loans serve borrowers with substantial liquid assets but limited documented income—particularly retirees and high-net-worth individuals.
        </p>

        <h3>How Asset Depletion Works</h3>
        <p>
          The lender calculates qualifying income by dividing eligible assets by the loan term. For example, a borrower with $2,000,000 in qualifying assets and a 30-year (360 month) loan term would have imputed monthly income of $5,555 ($2,000,000 / 360).
        </p>
        <p>
          Qualifying assets typically include checking and savings accounts, investment and brokerage accounts, retirement accounts (often at reduced percentage, such as 70% of value), and other liquid holdings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Non-qualifying assets usually include real estate equity, business ownership value, collectibles, and other illiquid assets.
        </p>

        <h3>Ideal Candidates for Asset Depletion</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Retirees:</strong> Significant assets but Social Security and pension income may be insufficient for conventional qualification</li>
          <li><strong>Early retirees:</strong> Left traditional employment but have substantial investments</li>
          <li><strong>Trust fund beneficiaries:</strong> Receive distributions that may not document as traditional income</li>
          <li><strong>Business sellers:</strong> Recently sold a business and have proceeds but no ongoing income</li>
          <li><strong>International executives:</strong> Foreign income difficult to document for US lending</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="foreign-national">Foreign National Loans: US Property for International Buyers</h2>
        <p>
          Foreign national loan programs enable non-US citizens to purchase property in the United States—a capability almost entirely absent from traditional bank lending.
        </p>

        <h3>How Foreign National Programs Work</h3>
        <p>
          These specialized programs accommodate borrowers without Social Security numbers, using Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITIN) or foreign passport identification. Income documentation comes from foreign employment verification, foreign bank statements, and international credit references. Larger down payments (25-35%) offset the unique risk factors.
        </p>

        <h3>Foreign National Program Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No US credit history required:</strong> International credit references accepted</li>
          <li><strong>Foreign income documentation:</strong> Translated documents from home country employers</li>
          <li><strong>ITIN acceptable:</strong> No SSN needed for most programs</li>
          <li><strong>Property types:</strong> Investment properties and second homes (primary residence varies)</li>
          <li><strong>Currency considerations:</strong> Some lenders require US bank account established</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="additional-programs">Additional Non-QM Programs Through Wholesale Brokers</h2>

        <h3>Interest-Only Loans</h3>
        <p>
          Interest-only programs allow borrowers to pay only interest for an initial period (typically 5-10 years), then transition to fully amortizing payments. Benefits include lower initial payments, cash flow flexibility, and strategic planning for income changes. These programs serve investors maximizing cash flow, borrowers expecting significant income increases, and those with strategic payoff plans.
        </p>

        <h3>Recent Credit Event Programs</h3>
        <p>
          Standard conventional guidelines require lengthy waiting periods after credit events such as bankruptcy (4-7 years), foreclosure (7 years), and short sale (4 years). Non-QM programs reduce these waiting periods significantly—often to 2 years or less with compensating factors. Borrowers pay higher down payments and rates but gain access to homeownership years sooner.
        </p>

        <h3>Profit and Loss Statement Loans</h3>
        <p>
          Some non-QM lenders accept CPA-prepared profit and loss statements to document self-employed income. This approach works for borrowers who keep excellent books but whose bank statement deposits don't reflect cash-basis income accurately.
        </p>

        <h3>1099 Income Loans</h3>
        <p>
          For independent contractors and gig economy workers, 1099 income loans use 12-24 months of 1099 forms to document income without requiring full tax returns. This simplifies documentation for consultants, freelancers, and contractors.
        </p>

        <h3>Jumbo Non-QM</h3>
        <p>
          Non-QM programs extend to jumbo loan amounts (above conforming limits). Wholesale brokers access jumbo non-QM lenders offering bank statement jumbo loans, asset depletion jumbo programs, and foreign national jumbo financing—often to $5M or higher.
        </p>

        <h2 id="wholesale-advantage">The Wholesale Broker Non-QM Advantage</h2>
        <p>
          Wholesale brokers provide unique value in the non-QM space that banks and direct lenders cannot match.
        </p>

        <h3>100+ Non-QM Lender Access</h3>
        <p>
          Established wholesale brokers maintain relationships with 100 or more non-QM specialty lenders. Each lender has different guidelines covering credit score minimums, LTV limits, and reserve requirements. Different lenders have different pricing structures. Some lenders specialize in specific programs (bank statement vs. DSCR vs. asset depletion). Guidelines change frequently, and brokers track these changes across all lenders.
        </p>

        <h3>Program Matching Expertise</h3>
        <p>
          Mo Abdel notes: "A self-employed borrower with a 640 credit score, 20% down, and bank statements showing strong deposits needs a specific type of lender. I know which of my 50+ bank statement lenders work best for that profile. A bank either has that one program or doesn't—they can't match borrowers to ideal programs because they only have one option."
        </p>

        <h3>Guideline Flexibility</h3>
        <p>
          When one non-QM lender declines based on their guidelines, a broker can immediately submit to another lender with different criteria. Different credit score requirements, different LTV limits, and different documentation flexibility across 100+ lenders means more paths to approval.
        </p>

        <h3>Competitive Pricing Through Choice</h3>
        <p>
          Non-QM pricing varies significantly between lenders. With access to 100+ options, brokers identify the most competitive pricing for each borrower's specific profile rather than accepting whatever single option a bank might offer.

        <h2 id="who-needs-non-qm">Who Needs Non-QM Loans?</h2>

        <h3>Self-Employed Business Owners</h3>
        <p>
          The primary non-QM demographic includes business owners whose tax returns don't reflect actual income due to legitimate business deductions, entrepreneurs with strong bank deposits but complex tax situations, consultants and contractors with variable income patterns, and professionals who maximize tax deductions.
        </p>

        <h3>Real Estate Investors</h3>
        <p>
          Investors benefit from DSCR programs for rental property acquisition, portfolio expansion without personal income verification, LLC financing for liability protection, and interest-only options for cash flow optimization.
        </p>

        <h3>High Net Worth Individuals</h3>
        <p>
          Wealthy borrowers often need asset depletion for substantial assets but limited income documentation, interest-only for cash flow management, jumbo non-QM for high-value properties, and foreign national programs for international investors.
        </p>

        <h3>Credit Recovery Borrowers</h3>
        <p>
          Those rebuilding after credit events benefit from shortened waiting periods after bankruptcy, foreclosure, or short sale, as well as programs focusing on current financial strength rather than past events.
        </p>

        <h3>Foreign Nationals</h3>
        <p>
          International buyers need specialized documentation acceptance, financing without US credit history, and programs designed for non-US residents.
        </p>

        <h2 id="people-also-ask">People Also Ask: Non-QM Loans Through Wholesale Brokers</h2>

        <h3>Is a non-QM loan a bad thing?</h3>
        <p>
          No, non-QM loans are legitimate mortgage products serving borrowers with non-traditional documentation or financing needs. They verify ability to repay using alternative methods and include strong borrower protections. The "non-qualified" designation relates to documentation methodology, not loan quality or borrower capability.
        </p>

        <h3>Why would someone choose a non-QM loan over a conventional loan?</h3>
        <p>
          Borrowers choose non-QM loans because they cannot qualify for conventional financing despite having clear ability to repay. Self-employed individuals whose tax returns understate income, investors purchasing rental properties, and foreign nationals without US credit history all have legitimate needs that conventional guidelines cannot address.
        </p>

        <h3>Are non-QM loan rates much higher than conventional rates?</h3>
        <p>
          Non-QM rates are generally higher than conventional rates, reflecting the specialized nature of these products and the fact that they cannot be sold to government-sponsored enterprises. The premium varies by program type, credit profile, and down payment. For borrowers who cannot qualify conventionally, non-QM loans provide access that wouldn't otherwise exist.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I refinance out of a non-QM loan later?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, many borrowers use non-QM loans as bridge financing. After building equity, improving credit, or changing their income documentation situation, they can refinance into conventional programs if those programs become available to them. Non-QM loans often don't have prepayment penalties (though some do—verify with your broker).
        </p>

        <h3>How do I know if I need a non-QM loan?</h3>
        <p>
          If you've been declined by a bank due to income documentation, debt-to-income ratio, recent credit events, or non-US citizen status, non-QM programs likely address your situation. A wholesale broker can evaluate your profile and determine which programs fit your needs.
        </p>

        <h3>Do all mortgage brokers offer non-QM loans?</h3>
        <p>
          Not all brokers have extensive non-QM lender relationships. Ask specifically how many non-QM lenders the broker works with. Established brokers in this space have relationships with 100+ specialty lenders.
        </p>

        <h2 id="faqs">Extended FAQ: Non-QM Loans Through Wholesale Brokers</h2>

        <h3>What is a non-QM loan?</h3>
        <p>
          A non-QM (non-qualified mortgage) loan is a mortgage that doesn't meet the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's qualified mortgage standards. These loans use alternative documentation methods to verify ability to repay and serve borrowers who don't fit conventional lending boxes: self-employed individuals, real estate investors, foreign nationals, and those with recent credit events.
        </p>

        <h3>Why can wholesale brokers access non-QM programs that banks cannot?</h3>
        <p>
          Banks primarily originate qualified mortgages they can sell to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Non-QM loans require relationships with private investors and specialty lenders that banks don't maintain. Wholesale brokers build relationships with 100+ non-QM lenders specifically designed for these specialty products.
        </p>

        <h3>What types of non-QM loans are available through wholesale brokers?</h3>
        <p>
          Wholesale brokers access bank statement loans (self-employed), DSCR investment property loans, asset depletion programs, interest-only mortgages, foreign national loans, recent credit event programs, and profit-and-loss statement loans. Each program serves specific borrower needs that conventional loans cannot address.
        </p>

        <h3>Are non-QM loans safe and legitimate?</h3>
        <p>
          Modern non-QM loans are legitimate mortgage products with strong borrower protections. They verify ability to repay using alternative methods and follow state and federal lending regulations. These are not subprime loans—they serve capable borrowers with non-traditional income documentation or investment goals.
        </p>

        <h3>What credit score is required for non-QM loans?</h3>
        <p>
          Credit requirements vary by program. Bank statement loans typically require 620-700+, DSCR loans 660-720+, asset depletion 680+, and foreign national 680+. Wholesale brokers access lenders across all credit tiers, with some programs available for scores as low as 500 with compensating factors.
        </p>

        <h3>How much down payment do non-QM loans require?</h3>
        <p>
          Down payment requirements are generally higher than conventional loans to offset risk. Bank statement loans typically require 10-20% down, DSCR loans 20-25%, asset depletion 20-30%, and foreign national 25-35%. Specific requirements vary by lender, credit score, and loan amount.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I get a non-QM loan for investment property?</h3>
        <p>
          DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio) loans are specifically designed for investment property. They qualify based on the property's rental income rather than borrower personal income. Wholesale brokers access 40+ DSCR lenders, making these programs readily available for real estate investors.
        </p>

        <h3>How do bank statement loans work?</h3>
        <p>
          Bank statement loans use 12-24 months of bank deposits to calculate income instead of tax returns. This benefits self-employed borrowers whose tax returns understate actual cash flow due to business deductions. The lender analyzes deposit patterns to determine qualifying income.
        </p>

        <h3>What is an asset depletion loan?</h3>
        <p>
          Asset depletion loans allow borrowers to qualify using liquid assets instead of traditional income. The lender divides total qualifying assets by the loan term to calculate imputed monthly income. This works well for retirees and high-net-worth individuals with substantial assets but limited documented income.
        </p>

        <h3>Can foreign nationals get mortgages in the US?</h3>
        <p>
          Foreign nationals can obtain US mortgages through wholesale broker channels. These programs accept foreign income documentation, work without Social Security numbers (using ITIN), and typically require 25-35% down payment. They're available for investment properties and second homes.
        </p>

        <h3>How quickly can I close on a non-QM loan?</h3>
        <p>
          Non-QM loans typically close in 21-30 days, similar to conventional loans. Some specialty lenders close faster; others require more time for unique documentation review. Wholesale brokers know which lenders close quickest and can match urgency to lender capability.
        </p>

        <h3>Are non-QM loan rates higher than conventional rates?</h3>
        <p>
          Non-QM rates are generally higher than conventional rates because these loans carry more risk and cannot be sold to government-sponsored enterprises. The rate premium varies by program type and borrower profile. However, for borrowers who cannot qualify conventionally, non-QM loans provide access to homeownership and investment that would otherwise be impossible.
        </p>
