          <p>
            According to Mo Abdel, NMLS #1426884, condo owners 62 and older can access a reverse mortgage (HECM) — but the condominium complex must meet FHA approval requirements, which have expanded significantly since HUD&apos;s 2019 policy changes opened eligibility to thousands of previously excluded communities. Before those changes, condo owners faced one of the most restrictive barriers to reverse mortgage access: full FHA project approval was the only pathway, and fewer than 10,000 complexes nationwide qualified. Today, over 30,000 condo communities hold active FHA approval, and the single-unit approval option provides an alternative route for units in non-approved projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            The distinction matters because roughly 17% of U.S. homeowners 62 and older live in condominiums, according to American Housing Survey data. In California and Washington coastal markets, that percentage climbs higher — many affluent retirees own condos in communities like Newport Beach, Laguna Beach, Bellevue, and Kirkland where the median condo value exceeds $800,000. These owners hold substantial equity but frequently assume they cannot access it through a reverse mortgage because their HOA never pursued FHA certification. That assumption is often incorrect.
          </p>
          <p>
            Three pathways now exist for condo reverse mortgage financing:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>FHA-approved condos</strong> qualify for standard HECM reverse mortgages — over 30,000 complexes nationwide now hold active approval</li>
            <li><strong>Single-unit FHA approval</strong> allows individual condo reverse mortgages even in non-FHA-approved complexes, provided the unit and project meet a streamlined set of criteria</li>
            <li><strong>Proprietary reverse mortgages</strong> serve non-warrantable condos through wholesale broker channels with no FHA ceiling and no project approval requirement</li>
          </ul>

          What Are the Reverse Mortgage Condo Requirements in 2026?
        </h2>

        <p>
          A condominium must satisfy one of three approval pathways before a reverse mortgage can close: full FHA project approval, single-unit FHA approval, or qualification under a proprietary (non-FHA) reverse mortgage program. The requirements differ for each pathway, but all three share a core principle — the lender and insurer need assurance that the condo project is financially stable, properly insured, and primarily residential.

          For HECM (Home Equity Conversion Mortgage) loans — the FHA-insured reverse mortgage used by the vast majority of borrowers — the condo project must meet HUD&apos;s condominium approval standards. These standards evaluate seven primary criteria that determine whether the complex qualifies:
        </p>

        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4 my-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Owner-Occupancy Ratio:</strong> At least 50% of units must be owner-occupied as primary residences. Investor-heavy projects with rental concentrations above 50% do not qualify for FHA condo approval.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hazard and Liability Insurance:</strong> The HOA master policy must carry hazard insurance covering 100% replacement cost, general liability insurance (minimum $1 million per occurrence), and fidelity bond coverage for projects with more than 20 units.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reserve Funding:</strong> The HOA budget must allocate at least 10% of annual assessments to a capital reserve fund. Projects relying on special assessments instead of adequate reserves pose financial risk to FHA borrowers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Active Litigation:</strong> The complex cannot have pending litigation that materially affects the project&apos;s financial viability, safety, or structural integrity. Construction defect lawsuits and special assessment disputes frequently trigger this disqualification.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Commercial Space Limitation:</strong> No more than 35% of the project&apos;s total floor area can be devoted to commercial or non-residential use. Mixed-use developments exceeding this threshold cannot obtain FHA certification.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Assessment Delinquency:</strong> No more than 15% of total units can be 60 or more days delinquent on HOA assessments. Excessive delinquencies indicate the project faces collection problems that threaten maintenance and reserves.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Single-Entity Concentration:</strong> No single entity (individual, investor, or corporation) can own more than 10% of units in projects with more than 20 units. This prevents excessive investor or developer concentration that could destabilize the community.
          </li>
        </ol>

          How Does FHA Condo Approval Work for HECM Loans?
        </h2>

        <p>
          FHA condo approval operates at the project level, meaning the entire condominium complex — not just the individual unit — must be certified. The HOA or management company initiates the approval process by submitting documentation to HUD through the <a href="https://entp.hud.gov/idapp/html/condlook.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">FHA Condominium Project Approval portal</a>. Once approved, every eligible unit in the project can qualify for FHA-insured financing, including HECM reverse mortgages.
        </p>

        <p>
          The approval process requires the HOA to provide:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-6">
          <li>Current year&apos;s adopted budget showing reserve allocation</li>
          <li>Master insurance certificate (hazard, liability, fidelity bond)</li>
          <li>CC&Rs (Covenants, Conditions & Restrictions) and bylaws</li>
          <li>Financial statements or audit for the most recent fiscal year</li>
          <li>Certification of owner-occupancy and delinquency ratios</li>
          <li>Disclosure of pending litigation, if any</li>
          <li>Management agreement (if professionally managed)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Approval is valid for three years. The HOA must file for recertification before expiration — a step that many associations overlook, inadvertently blocking unit owners from HECM and FHA forward loan eligibility until recertification is complete.

          What Is the Single-Unit FHA Approval Process for Condo Reverse Mortgages?
        </h2>

        <p>
          HUD introduced the single-unit approval pathway in October 2019 through FHA Condominium Policy changes outlined in the <em>Housing and Economic Recovery Act implementation</em>. This pathway was a direct response to industry feedback that full project approval created an impossible barrier for condo owners in communities where the HOA had no interest in pursuing FHA certification.
        </p>

        <p>
          Under single-unit approval, the HECM lender — rather than HUD — evaluates whether the specific unit and its condo project meet a streamlined set of requirements. The lender reviews:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-6">
          <li>Owner-occupancy ratio (still requires 50% minimum)</li>
          <li>No more than 10% of units owned by a single entity</li>
          <li>Adequate insurance coverage on the master policy</li>
          <li>The project is complete (not in a phased construction stage)</li>
          <li>No unsafe conditions or structural deficiencies</li>
          <li>The project is primarily residential (commercial space limit applies)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In our Orange County condo HECM closings, single-unit approval has expanded access for owners in communities that previously had zero FHA loan activity. Complexes in Newport Beach, Irvine, and Laguna Beach that never sought FHA certification — often because the HOA board considered it unnecessary given the property values — now have a viable path for individual unit owners who want a reverse mortgage. The key limitation is that the lender assumes certification liability, which means some lenders decline single-unit approval due to the additional risk exposure. Working with a wholesale broker who has access to 200+ lenders increases the odds of finding an institution that actively supports this pathway.
        </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Single-Unit vs. Full Project: Key Difference</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            With full FHA project approval, every unit in the complex is eligible for FHA financing. With single-unit approval, only the specific unit being financed is evaluated and approved. If your neighbor in the same building wants a HECM, they must obtain their own single-unit approval through their lender.

          Can You Get a Reverse Mortgage on a Non-Warrantable Condo?
        </h2>

        <p>
          Yes. <Link href="/blog/proprietary-reverse-mortgage-2026" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Proprietary reverse mortgages</Link> exist specifically to serve property types and values that fall outside FHA guidelines. A non-warrantable condo — one that fails FHA requirements due to investor concentration, litigation, inadequate reserves, excessive commercial space, or other disqualifying factors — can still be financed through a proprietary reverse mortgage program.
        </p>

        <p>
          Proprietary reverse mortgages are private-label products issued by individual lenders without FHA insurance. The advantages include:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-6">
          <li><strong>No FHA project approval required:</strong> The lender sets its own property eligibility criteria</li>
          <li><strong>Higher lending limits:</strong> Some programs extend to $4 million or more, far exceeding the HECM ceiling of $1,209,750</li>
          <li><strong>Flexible property types:</strong> Condotels, non-warrantable condos, and certain co-ops may qualify</li>
          <li><strong>No FHA mortgage insurance premium:</strong> Eliminates the 2% upfront and 0.5% annual MIP charges</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The tradeoffs are meaningful. Proprietary reverse mortgages typically carry higher interest rates (often 1-2 percentage points above comparable HECM rates), fewer payout options (many offer lump sum only, not a line of credit), and lack the FHA non-recourse guarantee that protects HECM borrowers and their heirs from owing more than the home&apos;s fair market value. In our experience, proprietary products work best for condo owners with high-value units — typically $1 million and above — where the HECM lending limit would capture only a fraction of their equity.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
          How Do HOA Fees and Assessments Affect HECM Condo Proceeds?
        </h2>

        <p>
          HOA dues are a mandatory ongoing obligation for reverse mortgage borrowers, just like property taxes and homeowners insurance. Failure to pay HOA assessments can trigger loan default and, in severe cases, foreclosure — the same consequence as failing to pay property taxes. This is a critical point that every condo HECM applicant must understand: <strong>the borrower must continue to pay property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and maintain the property</strong> throughout the life of the loan.
        </p>

        <p>
          HOA fees affect reverse mortgage economics in two direct ways:
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>1. Financial Assessment Impact:</strong> During the HECM application, the lender performs a financial assessment to determine whether the borrower can sustain ongoing property charges. HOA dues increase the monthly obligation threshold. If the assessment reveals insufficient residual income after accounting for taxes, insurance, and HOA fees, the lender may require a Life Expectancy Set-Aside (LESA) — a portion of the reverse mortgage proceeds held in escrow to cover future property charges. A LESA reduces the net cash available to the borrower.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>2. Effective Benefit Calculation:</strong> A condo owner with $600/month in HOA dues has a materially different reverse mortgage experience than a single-family homeowner with no HOA obligation. While the reverse mortgage eliminates the monthly principal and interest payment, the HOA dues persist as a fixed cost. Borrowers should factor this ongoing expense into their reverse mortgage planning.
        </p>

        <p>
          Special assessments present an additional risk. If the HOA levies a major special assessment — for roof replacement, elevator modernization, or building remediation — the condo owner must pay their share. As discussed in our <Link href="/blog/reverse-mortgage-complete-guide-2026" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">complete reverse mortgage guide</Link>, maintaining the property and paying all associated charges is a core requirement of the HECM program.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">
          What Happens to the Condo Reverse Mortgage When the HOA Changes Rules?
        </h2>

        <p>
          An existing HECM reverse mortgage is not affected by subsequent HOA rule changes. Once the loan closes, the borrower&apos;s rights under the HECM contract are governed by the loan documents and FHA regulations — not by HOA policy. The lender cannot call the loan due simply because the HOA amends its CC&Rs or bylaws.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, HOA changes can affect other aspects of condo living with a reverse mortgage:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 my-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Insurance changes:</strong> If the HOA reduces master policy coverage below FHA minimums, the lender may require the borrower to obtain supplemental coverage at their own expense
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Assessment increases:</strong> Rising HOA dues increase the borrower&apos;s monthly obligations, which must be sustained to avoid default
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rental restriction changes:</strong> New rental restrictions do not affect the borrower (who must owner-occupy), but changes relaxing rental rules could shift the owner-occupancy ratio, affecting future HECM applicants in the complex
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>FHA approval lapse:</strong> If the HOA fails to recertify and the project loses FHA approval, existing HECM borrowers are unaffected, but new applicants cannot obtain a HECM until recertification is complete
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The most common concern we hear from condo HECM borrowers is about special assessments. As detailed in the <Link href="/blog/reverse-mortgage-requirements-complete-2026" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">HECM requirements guide</Link>, borrowers must have the financial capacity to absorb unexpected costs. We recommend that condo owners considering a reverse mortgage review the HOA&apos;s reserve study and recent meeting minutes for any planned capital expenditures before proceeding.

            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              <strong>Yes, if your condo has FHA project approval, qualifies for single-unit approval, or you use a proprietary reverse mortgage product.</strong> Check the HUD Condo Lookup tool to verify your complex&apos;s FHA status. If not listed, single-unit approval or a proprietary program provides alternative pathways.

            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              <strong>Your existing reverse mortgage remains fully intact and unaffected by the project&apos;s FHA status change.</strong> Once the HECM closes, the loan terms are locked. Only new applicants in the complex would be unable to obtain FHA-insured reverse mortgages until the project regains approval.

            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              <strong>Your HOA submits project documents to HUD for review, or you request single-unit approval through your HECM lender.</strong> Full project approval requires HOA cooperation and takes 30-60 days. Single-unit approval is handled by the lender within the normal HECM processing timeline.

              Do condos have the same HECM loan limits as houses?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              <strong>Yes, HECM loan limits are the same for condos and single-family homes: $1,209,750 in high-cost areas for 2026.</strong> The limit is based on the county FHA ceiling, not the property type. Proprietary reverse mortgages offer higher limits for condos exceeding the FHA cap.

            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              <strong>An HOA cannot directly prohibit a reverse mortgage, but it can refuse to pursue FHA project approval.</strong> If the HOA declines to seek FHA certification, your options are single-unit approval (if the project meets basic criteria) or a proprietary reverse mortgage that requires no FHA involvement.

              Are reverse mortgage closing costs higher for condos?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              <strong>HECM closing costs for condos are comparable to single-family homes, with potential $100-$300 project review fees.</strong> The FHA mortgage insurance premium (2% upfront), origination fee, and standard third-party costs are identical. Single-unit approval may add a modest condo certification charge.

            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              <strong>A condotel is a condo unit operated as a hotel, and it does not qualify for a HECM reverse mortgage.</strong> Condotels fail the owner-occupancy and primary residence requirements. Some proprietary reverse mortgage lenders accept condotels, though options are limited and rates are higher.

            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              <strong>Yes, borrowers need HO-6 (walls-in) coverage in addition to the HOA&apos;s master policy for HECM approval.</strong> The HO-6 policy covers the interior of your unit, personal property, and liability not covered by the master policy. Your lender will verify both policies during underwriting.

              What owner-occupancy ratio does FHA require for condo HECM approval?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              FHA requires at least 50% of condo units to be owner-occupied for both full project approval and single-unit approval. Complexes where more than half the units are renter-occupied or investor-owned cannot meet this threshold. The ratio is calculated based on the entire project, not individual buildings within a multi-building community.
            </p>
          </div>

              What reserve fund percentage does FHA require for condo reverse mortgage approval?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              The HOA budget must allocate at least 10% of annual assessments to a capital reserve fund. Projects with less than 10% in reserves risk special assessments that could burden reverse mortgage borrowers. A current reserve study showing adequate funding strengthens the project&apos;s FHA approval application.

              Can pending litigation disqualify a condo from HECM approval?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Yes. Active litigation that materially affects financial stability, structural integrity, or safety disqualifies the project from FHA approval. Construction defect lawsuits, large-dollar assessment disputes, and habitability claims are common disqualifiers. Minor claims like personal injury lawsuits against the HOA typically do not block approval.

              What percentage of commercial space disqualifies FHA condo approval?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              No more than 35% of the project&apos;s total floor area can be commercial or non-residential space. Mixed-use developments in downtown or urban areas frequently exceed this limit. If your complex has ground-floor retail exceeding the threshold, a proprietary reverse mortgage is the alternative pathway.

              Does FHA condo approval expire?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Yes, FHA condo project approval expires after three years and must be renewed through recertification. The HOA is responsible for initiating the renewal process. If approval lapses, unit owners cannot obtain new FHA-insured loans — including HECM reverse mortgages — until recertification is complete.

              What insurance does a condo need for HECM reverse mortgage approval?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              The HOA master policy must include hazard insurance at 100% replacement cost, general liability insurance (minimum $1 million per occurrence), flood insurance if the project is in a FEMA-designated flood zone, and fidelity bond coverage for projects with more than 20 units. Individual borrowers also need HO-6 walls-in coverage.

              What happens if my condo HOA has delinquent unit owners?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              FHA requires that no more than 15% of units be 60 or more days delinquent on HOA assessments. Excessive delinquencies signal financial instability that threatens the project&apos;s ability to fund operations and reserves. The HOA must provide a current delinquency report as part of the FHA approval application.

            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              If the HOA refuses to pursue FHA project approval, the single-unit approval pathway allows your lender to evaluate the unit independently — though some HOA documents are still needed. If the HOA refuses to provide any documentation, a proprietary reverse mortgage that bypasses FHA requirements entirely becomes the practical option.

              Is HUD counseling required for a condo reverse mortgage?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Yes. HUD-approved counseling is mandatory for all HECM reverse mortgages regardless of property type. The counselor will explain loan terms, costs, alternatives, and your ongoing obligations including the requirement to pay property taxes, HOA dues, insurance, and maintain the property. Counseling costs approximately $125 and must be completed before application processing.

            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Standard HECM reverse mortgages do not cover co-op apartments because the borrower does not hold real property title — they own shares in a cooperative corporation. Some proprietary reverse mortgage lenders offer co-op programs in select markets, but availability is extremely limited and terms differ significantly from standard reverse mortgages.

            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Yes. Older borrowers qualify for a higher percentage of the home&apos;s value through the HECM principal limit factor. A 72-year-old typically accesses approximately 52% of the condo value (up to the FHA limit), while a 62-year-old accesses approximately 40%.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Condo owners 62 and older have more reverse mortgage options today than at any point in the program&apos;s history. FHA project approval, single-unit approval, and proprietary products create three distinct pathways — and a qualified wholesale mortgage broker with access to 200+ lenders can identify which route fits your specific condominium and financial situation. The first step is determining your condo&apos;s FHA approval status and evaluating whether the complex meets the core requirements.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            As a licensed mortgage broker serving California and Washington, I work with condo owners throughout Orange County, the Bay Area, Los Angeles, San Diego, Seattle, and Bellevue to navigate the condo HECM approval process. Whether your complex holds full FHA approval, needs single-unit certification, or requires a proprietary solution, I match you with the right lender from our network of 200+ institutions.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-6">
            Reverse mortgage proceeds are generally not considered taxable income (consult your tax advisor). Borrower must be 62 or older and complete HUD-approved counseling. Borrower must continue to pay property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and maintain the property. No required monthly principal and interest payments, but the loan balance grows over time.
