                <h2 id="rate-and-term">What Is a Rate-and-Term Refinance?</h2>
                <p>
                    A rate-and-term refinance (also called a "no cash-out" refinance) replaces your existing mortgage with a new loan that changes your interest rate, loan term, or both - without extracting equity. The new loan amount covers only your existing balance plus closing costs.
                </p>

                <h3>Common Goals for Rate-and-Term Refinancing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lower your interest rate</strong> - Reduce monthly payments and total interest paid</li>
                    <li><strong>Shorten your loan term</strong> - Pay off your home faster (30-year to 15-year)</li>
                    <li><strong>Extend your loan term</strong> - Lower payments by stretching remaining balance</li>
                    <li><strong>Switch loan types</strong> - Convert ARM to fixed rate for stability</li>
                    <li><strong>Remove mortgage insurance</strong> - Eliminate PMI when equity reaches 20%</li>
                    <li><strong>Remove a co-borrower</strong> - Take sole ownership after divorce or separation</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    A cash-out refinance replaces your mortgage with a larger loan, giving you the difference as cash at closing. This allows you to convert home equity into liquid funds while potentially also changing your rate or term.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a detailed explanation of cash-out mechanics, see our <a href="/blog/cash-out-refinance-how-it-works-2026" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Cash-Out Refinance: How It Works</a> guide.
                </p>

                <h3>Common Uses for Cash-Out Refinancing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Home improvements</strong> - Renovations that increase property value</li>
                    <li><strong>Debt consolidation</strong> - Pay off high-interest credit cards and loans</li>
                    <li><strong>Investment opportunities</strong> - Fund investment property down payments</li>
                    <li><strong>Major expenses</strong> - Education, medical bills, business funding</li>
                    <li><strong>Emergency reserves</strong> - Build cash cushion for unexpected needs</li>
                </ul>

                        <li><strong>Home value:</strong> $900,000</li>
                        <li><strong>Current loan balance:</strong> $400,000</li>

                        <li><strong>Cash available:</strong> $320,000 (minus ~$15,000 closing costs)</li>
                        <li><strong>Net cash received:</strong> approximately $305,000</li>
                        <li><strong>New monthly payment:</strong> Higher due to larger loan balance</li>

                <h2 id="rate-comparison">Interest Rate Comparison: How Much More Does Cash-Out Cost?</h2>
                <p>
                    Cash-out refinance rates carry a premium over rate-and-term refinances. This pricing difference exists because lenders view cash-out loans as higher risk - borrowers extracting equity have less skin in the game.

                <h3>Choose Cash-Out Refinance When:</h3>
                <ul>

                <h2>Hybrid Strategy: Limited Cash-Out Refinance</h2>
                <p>
                    Some borrowers qualify for a "limited cash-out" refinance - essentially a rate-and-term refinance that allows up to $2,000 cash back at closing. This option:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gets rate-and-term pricing (lower rates)</li>
                    <li>Allows small cash back for minor expenses</li>
                    <li>Keeps higher LTV limits available</li>
                    <li>Requires less equity than full cash-out</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3>What is the difference between cash-out and regular refinance?</h3>
                <p>
                    A regular (rate-and-term) refinance replaces your existing mortgage with a new loan to change your rate or term without taking cash. A cash-out refinance replaces your mortgage with a larger loan, giving you the difference in cash. Cash-out refinances have higher rates (0.125-0.5% more) and stricter requirements.
                </p>

                <h3>Are cash-out refinance rates higher than regular refinance?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes. Cash-out refinance rates are typically 0.125% to 0.5% higher than rate-and-term refinance rates. This premium reflects the higher risk to lenders when borrowers extract equity. A borrower who qualifies for 6.5% on a rate-and-term refinance might see 6.75-7.0% for cash-out.
                </p>

                <h3>Can I switch from a cash-out to a regular refinance?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes. If you discover during the process that rate-and-term refinancing offers better terms, you can request your loan be restructured. However, once you close on a cash-out refinance, you would need to wait and refinance again to change terms.
                </p>

                <h3>What are the LTV limits for cash-out vs regular refinance?</h3>
                <p>
                    Rate-and-term refinances allow up to 97% LTV for primary residences with conventional loans. Cash-out refinances cap at 80% LTV for conventional loans. VA loans allow 100% LTV for both rate-and-term and cash-out refinances for eligible veterans.
                </p>

                <h3>Is a regular refinance faster than cash-out?</h3>
                <p>
                    Generally yes. Rate-and-term refinances often close in 21-30 days due to simpler underwriting. Cash-out refinances typically take 30-45 days because of additional verification requirements and the 3-day rescission period for primary residences.
                </p>

                <h3>Which refinance option has lower closing costs?</h3>
                <p>
                    Rate-and-term refinances often have lower closing costs because loan amounts are smaller. However, both types have similar fee structures (2-5% of loan amount). Some lenders offer no-closing-cost options for rate-and-term refinances with slightly higher rates.
                </p>

                <h3>How much cash can I receive with a cash-out refinance?</h3>
                <p>
                    You can typically access up to 80% of your home's value minus your current loan balance. For example, with a $1 million home and $500,000 mortgage, you could potentially borrow up to $800,000, receiving $300,000 in cash (minus closing costs). VA allows 100% LTV.
