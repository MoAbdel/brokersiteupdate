            A cash-out refinance replaces your existing mortgage with a new, larger loan—giving you the difference in cash. In 2026, most lenders require at least 20% equity remaining after the cash-out, a credit score of 620+, and a debt-to-income ratio below 43%. This option works best when you need a large lump sum and can benefit from current market conditions compared to your existing mortgage terms.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">How Does Cash-Out Refinance Work Step by Step?</h2>
          <p>
            Understanding cash out refinance how it works starts with the basic mechanics. When you complete a cash-out refinance, your new mortgage pays off your existing loan, and you receive the equity difference as cash at closing.
          </p>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Apply with a lender</strong> — Submit income, credit, and property documentation</li>
            <li><strong>Property appraisal</strong> — Determines current market value and available equity</li>
            <li><strong>Underwriting review</strong> — Lender verifies income, credit, and calculates maximum loan amount</li>
            <li><strong>Loan approval</strong> — Receive terms including interest rate and closing costs</li>
            <li><strong>Closing</strong> — Sign documents, new loan pays off old mortgage</li>
            <li><strong>Receive funds</strong> — Cash typically disbursed 3 days after closing (rescission period)</li>
          </ol>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Cash-Out Refinance Requirements in 2026</h2>
          <p>
            To qualify for a cash-out refinance, you&apos;ll need to meet several requirements. As a wholesale mortgage broker, I access multiple lenders with varying qualification criteria to find options that fit your situation.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">
            <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-3">Typical Cash-Out Refinance Requirements:</h3>
            <ul className="space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Credit Score:</strong> 620+ for conventional; 580+ for FHA</li>
              <li><strong>Equity:</strong> Minimum 20% remaining after cash-out (80% max LTV)</li>
              <li><strong>Debt-to-Income:</strong> Generally 43% or below</li>
              <li><strong>Seasoning:</strong> Typically 6-12 months since last refinance</li>
              <li><strong>Property Type:</strong> Primary residence, second home, or investment</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">How Much Cash Can You Get From a Cash-Out Refinance?</h2>
          <p>
            The amount you can access depends on your home&apos;s current value and existing mortgage balance. Most conventional lenders allow up to 80% loan-to-value, meaning you can borrow up to 80% of your home&apos;s appraised value minus your current mortgage balance.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Example calculation:</strong> If your home appraises at $800,000 and you owe $400,000, you could potentially access up to $240,000 in cash (80% of $800,000 = $640,000, minus $400,000 owed = $240,000).
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Cash-Out Refinance Costs and Fees</h2>
          <p>
            A cash-out refinance involves closing costs similar to your original mortgage. Typical costs range from 2-5% of the loan amount and may include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Appraisal fee</li>
            <li>Origination fee</li>
            <li>Title insurance and search</li>
            <li>Recording fees</li>
            <li>Credit report fee</li>
            <li>Escrow fees</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-4">
            As a wholesale broker, I can often access reduced pricing through lender relationships, potentially lowering your overall costs compared to retail channels.
