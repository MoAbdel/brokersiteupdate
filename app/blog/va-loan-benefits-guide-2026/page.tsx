                <h2>What are the main VA loan benefits in 2026?</h2>
                <p>
                    VA loans remain one of the most powerful home financing tools available. Here's what makes them exceptional:
                </p>

                <h3>1. Zero Down Payment</h3>
                <p>
                    The most significant VA loan benefit is 100% financing:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No down payment required for full entitlement borrowers</li>
                    <li>Purchase homes up to any amount lenders will approve</li>
                    <li>Keep cash reserves for other needs</li>
                    <li>No loan limits for veterans with full entitlement</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. No Monthly Mortgage Insurance</h3>
                <p>
                    Unlike FHA and conventional loans with less than 20% down, VA loans have no PMI:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Save hundreds per month compared to other loan types</li>
                    <li>Lower monthly payments throughout the loan</li>
                    <li>More buying power with the same income</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Competitive Interest Rates</h3>
                <p>
                    VA loans typically offer rates 0.25-0.5% lower than conventional loans:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Government backing reduces lender risk</li>
                    <li>Wholesale brokers can find the most competitive VA rates</li>
                    <li>Rate savings compound over the life of the loan</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Flexible Qualification Requirements</h3>
                <p>
                    VA guidelines are more forgiving than conventional loans:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No minimum credit score set by VA (lenders typically require 580-620+)</li>
                    <li>Higher debt-to-income ratios allowed (up to 50%+)</li>
                    <li>Manual underwriting available for complex files</li>
                    <li>Bankruptcy and foreclosure waiting periods shorter</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Who is eligible for a VA loan in 2026?</h2>
                <p>
                    VA loan eligibility extends to:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Active Duty</strong> - Currently serving after 90 consecutive days</li>
                    <li><strong>Veterans</strong> - Honorably discharged after required service period</li>
                    <li><strong>National Guard</strong> - 6 years service or 90 days active duty</li>
                    <li><strong>Reserves</strong> - 6 years service or 90 days active duty</li>
                    <li><strong>Surviving Spouses</strong> - Of veterans who died in service or from service-connected causes</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>VA loan limits in 2026</h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding VA loan limits:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Full entitlement</strong> - No loan limit with zero down payment</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduced entitlement</strong> - County limits apply (Orange County: $1,266,300)</li>
                    <li><strong>Jumbo VA loans</strong> - Available above county limits with down payment</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>VA funding fee explained</h2>
                <p>
                    The VA funding fee helps sustain the program:
                </p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3>What are the main benefits of a VA loan in 2026?</h3>
                <p>
                    VA loans offer zero down payment, no monthly mortgage insurance (PMI), competitive interest rates, limited closing costs, and more flexible qualification requirements than conventional loans.
                </p>

                <h3>Who is eligible for a VA loan?</h3>
                <p>
                    VA loan eligibility includes active duty service members, veterans with honorable discharge, National Guard and Reserve members with qualifying service, and surviving spouses of veterans who died in service or from service-connected disabilities.
                </p>

                <h3>Is there a VA loan limit in 2026?</h3>
                <p>
                    For veterans with full entitlement, there is no VA loan limit - you can borrow any amount a lender will approve with zero down. Veterans with reduced entitlement follow county loan limits, which are $1,266,300 in Orange County for 2026.
                </p>

                <h3>What is the VA funding fee?</h3>
                <p>
                    The VA funding fee ranges from 1.25% to 3.3% of the loan amount depending on down payment and whether it's your first VA loan. Veterans with service-connected disabilities are exempt from the funding fee.
                </p>

                <h3>Can I use a VA loan more than once?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes, VA loan entitlement can be restored and reused multiple times. After selling a home with a VA loan or paying off the mortgage, your entitlement is restored. You may also have remaining entitlement for a second VA loan.
