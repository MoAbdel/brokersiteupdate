  const faqData = [
    {
      question: 'How much home equity can I access in Montecito?',
      answer: 'Montecito homeowners can typically access up to 65-75% of their home value minus the existing mortgage balance through super-jumbo equity products. With a median value of $8.5 million and many estates exceeding $15M-$50M+, qualifying homeowners access $3M-$20M+ through super-jumbo HELOCs, HELOANs, or cash-out refinance products available through wholesale broker access to specialized ultra-high-net-worth lenders. Montecito\'s extreme property values require lenders comfortable with $5M-$10M+ credit lines.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What HELOC options exist for Santa Barbara homes valued over $2 million?',
      answer: 'Santa Barbara homes exceeding $2 million require jumbo HELOC programs. Through wholesale broker access, credit lines of $500K-$3M+ are available from specialized lenders who serve the Central Coast luxury market. These programs accept complex income including entertainment royalties, trust distributions, investment income, and business ownership. Credit scores of 720+ and CLTV ratios under 75% typically qualify for the most competitive jumbo HELOC terms in the Santa Barbara market.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use trust income to qualify for a Montecito HELOC?',
      answer: 'Yes. Montecito\'s concentration of ultra-high-net-worth homeowners means wholesale lenders serving this market are experienced with trust income qualification. Irrevocable trust distributions, revocable living trust income, and family limited partnership distributions can all qualify as income with the appropriate documentation. Asset depletion programs also allow Montecito homeowners to qualify based on liquid assets rather than traditional income, which benefits retirees and individuals living on investment portfolios.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I get a HELOC or cash-out refinance on my Santa Barbara Riviera home?',
      answer: 'If your existing first mortgage rate is below current market rates, a HELOC or HELOAN preserves your low rate while providing equity access through a second lien. If your current rate exceeds today\'s market, a cash-out refinance replaces your mortgage at a lower rate while also providing equity. Most Santa Barbara homeowners who locked rates between 2020-2022 benefit from a HELOC or HELOAN as a second lien to preserve their favorable first mortgage terms.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does a super-jumbo HELOC take to close in Montecito?',
      answer: 'A super-jumbo HELOC in Montecito typically takes 4-8 weeks from application to funding due to the enhanced underwriting requirements for ultra-high-value properties. This includes full interior appraisal by a luxury property specialist (required for all homes above $3M), comprehensive income and asset verification, title work that may include trust review, and closing. Properties with complex ownership structures such as trusts, LLCs, or family partnerships require additional documentation review time.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What credit score do I need for a super-jumbo HELOC in Montecito?',
      answer: 'Most super-jumbo HELOC lenders serving Montecito require minimum credit scores of 720-740, with the best rates available at 780+. For credit lines above $3M, some lenders require 760+ scores. Through wholesale broker access to specialized ultra-high-net-worth lenders, competitive super-jumbo HELOC programs exist across multiple credit tiers, and compensating factors like substantial liquid reserves ($2M+ in post-closing assets) and very low CLTV ratios can offset credit requirements.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I get a HELOC on a fire-rebuilt home in Montecito or Santa Barbara?',
      answer: 'Yes, but with specific considerations. Homes rebuilt after the Thomas Fire (2017) or subsequent fires that have received certificates of occupancy and full insurance coverage qualify for standard HELOC products. The key is timing: lenders require that reconstruction is 100% complete with all permits finalized. For homes rebuilt to higher standards than the original, the new appraised value (often significantly higher than pre-fire value) forms the basis for equity calculation, frequently resulting in larger available credit lines.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is HELOC interest tax deductible on a Montecito estate?',
      answer: 'HELOC interest is potentially deductible on your federal taxes when funds are used to buy, build, or substantially improve the home securing the loan, up to the $750,000 combined mortgage interest deduction limit. California allows a similar state deduction. For Montecito estates with $5M-$20M+ in equity, only a portion of the interest may be deductible. Interest on HELOC funds used for non-home-improvement purposes is not deductible as mortgage interest. Consult your tax advisor for your specific situation.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the maximum HELOC I can get on an $8.5 million Montecito estate?',
      answer: 'On an $8.5 million Montecito estate, maximum HELOC amounts depend on your existing mortgage balance and the lender\'s maximum CLTV ratio. At 65% CLTV with a $2M existing mortgage, you access approximately $3.5M in HELOC credit. At 70% CLTV, approximately $3.95M. Specialized super-jumbo HELOC programs from private bank-grade wholesale lenders provide credit lines up to $10M+ for qualifying borrowers with substantial asset portfolios and strong credit profiles.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does a wholesale broker get better HELOC rates for Montecito properties?',
      answer: 'The super-jumbo HELOC market serving Montecito properties is concentrated among fewer than 15-20 specialized lenders nationally. Your bank likely offers a single product at one rate. A wholesale broker simultaneously compares products from all available super-jumbo lenders, creating competition for your high-value business. On credit lines of $3M-$10M+, even a 0.125% rate advantage saves $3,750-$12,500+ annually. The wholesale broker\'s lender network is especially valuable in the ultra-high-net-worth space where product variation is widest.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use a Carpinteria HELOC for vineyard or avocado ranch improvements?',
      answer: 'Yes. Carpinteria\'s agricultural properties, including avocado ranches and small vineyard parcels, generate agricultural income that some wholesale lenders count as qualifying income. A HELOC can fund irrigation system upgrades, orchard replanting, wine cave construction, or property improvements that increase both agricultural productivity and residential property value. Lenders experienced with agricultural-residential hybrid properties are available through wholesale broker channels.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Does my Montecito property held in a trust qualify for a HELOC?',
      answer: 'Yes, most jumbo and super-jumbo HELOC programs allow properties held in revocable living trusts. The trust documentation must include borrowing provisions and trustee authority to encumber the property. For irrevocable trusts or more complex structures (family LLCs, limited partnerships), specialized lenders accessible through wholesale broker channels accommodate these ownership arrangements. Trust review typically adds 3-7 days to the processing timeline but does not prevent HELOC approval.',

            The Central Coast luxury corridor &mdash; anchored by Montecito, Santa Barbara, and Carpinteria &mdash; represents one of the most exclusive residential equity markets in the world. Montecito&apos;s $8.5 million median home value places it among the wealthiest communities in the United States, where celebrity estates, billionaire compounds, and generational family properties create equity positions that dwarf any other California market outside perhaps Atherton and Beverly Hills. From Butterfly Beach oceanfront estates to Hope Ranch equestrian properties, and from Santa Barbara Riviera hilltop compounds to Carpinteria&apos;s Padaro Lane beachfront, homeowners in this corridor hold extraordinary wealth in their real estate that super-jumbo HELOC, HELOAN, and cash-out refinance products unlock. As a wholesale broker with access to the ultra-high-net-worth lender network, I help Central Coast homeowners navigate the super-jumbo equity landscape where fewer than 15&ndash;20 lenders nationally compete for this business.

Actual equity access depends on credit score, income or asset verification, lender programs, and current appraisal value.

          <p>
            Three primary products allow Central Coast luxury homeowners to access their home equity. Montecito operates almost exclusively in the super-jumbo space, while Santa Barbara and Carpinteria homeowners access both jumbo and super-jumbo products depending on property value. The ultra-luxury segment creates unique product dynamics: fewer lenders, higher minimum credit lines, enhanced underwriting, and asset-based qualification options not available in standard jumbo markets.

          <h2 id="montecito" className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Montecito Home Equity: Celebrity Estate &amp; Billionaire Retreat Financing</h2>
          <p>
            Montecito&apos;s $8.5 million median home value represents the highest in California&apos;s entire hub system &mdash; a community where Oprah Winfrey, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, Ellen DeGeneres, and dozens of other celebrities and billionaires have established estates that redefine luxury real estate. Butterfly Beach is the most coveted address, with oceanfront estates from $15M to over $100M featuring private beach access, panoramic Pacific views, and Montecito Union School district enrollment. The Ennisbrook enclave offers gated privacy with estates on 2&ndash;10+ acre parcels. Birnam Wood combines country club membership with valley views and 18-hole golf course frontage. Cold Spring Canyon features hillside retreats with creek-side settings and complete seclusion. The San Ysidro Ranch area provides agricultural zoning for vineyard and orchard properties that combine estate living with productive land.
          </p>
          <p>
            Montecito&apos;s equity landscape is unlike any other California market. Homeowners typically hold $4M&ndash;$20M+ in tappable equity, with many properties owned free and clear by ultra-high-net-worth individuals who paid cash at purchase. These homeowners access equity through super-jumbo HELOC products for estate renovation ($1M&ndash;$5M+ projects including fire-resistant landscaping, guest house construction, pool/spa complexes, and vineyard improvements), investment property acquisition (deploying $2M&ndash;$5M for commercial or residential portfolio expansion), and business capitalization. The qualification dynamic in Montecito is unique: traditional income documentation is often insufficient because wealth is held in trusts, family offices, investment portfolios, and business entities. Asset depletion programs &mdash; where liquid assets of $5M&ndash;$50M+ are divided over a 360-month term to create qualifying &quot;income&quot; &mdash; are the primary qualification vehicle for retired Montecito homeowners and those living on investment returns.

          <h2 id="santa-barbara" className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Santa Barbara Home Equity: Riviera, Hope Ranch &amp; Wine Lifestyle Wealth</h2>
          <p>
            Santa Barbara at $2.3 million median combines Mediterranean architecture, ocean views, and wine country lifestyle into one of California&apos;s most desirable markets. The Riviera &mdash; the hillside neighborhood above the Mission &mdash; commands the highest premiums within the city proper, with ocean-view homes from $3M&ndash;$8M featuring red-tile roofs and established gardens. Hope Ranch is Santa Barbara&apos;s premier equestrian community: a private, guard-gated enclave with private beach access, riding trails, lagoons, and estates from $4M&ndash;$15M+ on parcels of 1&ndash;20+ acres. Mission Canyon provides a wooded, secluded setting near the Botanic Garden with values from $2M&ndash;$5M. The Mesa offers ocean-view neighborhoods west of downtown with strong community identity and values from $1.5M&ndash;$3.5M. San Roque provides family-oriented neighborhoods near UCSB and Goleta with values from $1.5M&ndash;$2.5M.
          </p>
          <p>
            Santa Barbara&apos;s equity demand reflects its diverse homeowner population: UCSB faculty and researchers, retired professionals from across the country, tech entrepreneurs who relocated for lifestyle, wine industry proprietors, and professionals serving the Montecito ultra-wealthy. Hope Ranch homeowners use super-jumbo HELOCs for equestrian facility improvements ($200K&ndash;$800K for barns, arenas, and paddocks), while Riviera homeowners deploy equity for whole-home Mediterranean restoration projects that preserve architectural character while modernizing interiors. The Mesa and Mission Canyon attract renovation-focused buyers who access HELOCs for $300K&ndash;$600K improvement projects that capitalize on ocean views and outdoor living potential. Wine country connections drive vineyard investment &mdash; Santa Barbara homeowners frequently deploy HELOC funds as down payments on Santa Ynez Valley vineyard properties, leveraging residential equity to build agricultural portfolios.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Borrower scenario:</strong> A Hope Ranch estate owner (UCSB professor and partner who is a retired physician) with a $6.5M property, $2M existing mortgage, $280K combined income plus $180K portfolio income seeks a $1.5M HELOC for equestrian barn construction and arena installation. The property&apos;s 4-acre lot and Hope Ranch location support the full $1.5M request at 70% CLTV ($4.55M total borrowing capacity minus $2M existing = $2.55M available). Through wholesale lender matching, we identify a super-jumbo program accepting portfolio income at full value.

          <h2 id="carpinteria" className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Carpinteria Home Equity: Rincon Point Surf &amp; Padaro Lane Beachfront</h2>
          <p>
            Carpinteria at $2.5 million median occupies a unique position between Montecito&apos;s ultra-luxury market and Santa Barbara&apos;s broader residential base. Rincon Point &mdash; legendary among surfers as one of California&apos;s premier right-point breaks &mdash; features a private community of beachfront homes from $3M&ndash;$8M+ where ownership provides access to one of the most coveted surf locations in the world. Padaro Lane is Carpinteria&apos;s oceanfront road, with estates from $5M&ndash;$20M+ offering direct beach access and Montecito-adjacent privacy. Downtown Carpinteria provides a small-town commercial district with craftsman and ranch-style homes from $1.5M&ndash;$3M. Concha Loma offers hillside properties with mountain and ocean views from $2M&ndash;$4M. The avocado ranch properties east of town combine residential living with agricultural production on 2&ndash;10+ acre parcels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Carpinteria&apos;s equity story bridges residential luxury and agricultural value. Avocado ranch properties generate $15,000&ndash;$50,000+ in annual agricultural income that some wholesale lenders count as qualifying income, effectively increasing HELOC capacity. The Rincon Point community&apos;s surf culture attracts affluent homeowners who split time between Carpinteria and other residences &mdash; lenders comfortable with second-home HELOC structures (typically at 70% CLTV vs. 80% for primary residences) serve this market. Padaro Lane estates, while geographically in Carpinteria, command Montecito-level pricing and require super-jumbo HELOC products. The fire-rebuild dynamic is significant: Thomas Fire-damaged properties that have been rebuilt to modern fire-resistant standards appraise substantially higher than pre-fire values, creating equity positions that homeowners deploy through HELOCs for investment diversification, additional property acquisition, and lifestyle improvements.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Borrower scenario:</strong> A Rincon Point homeowner (retired tech founder) with a $5.2M beachfront property used as a primary residence, owned free and clear, $8M in liquid assets, and $50K annual avocado grove income from an adjacent parcel seeks a $2M HELOC to fund a commercial property purchase in downtown Santa Barbara. Through asset depletion qualification ($8M / 360 = $22,222/month) plus agricultural income, we secure a super-jumbo HELOC from a lender experienced with Central Coast agricultural-residential hybrid properties.

          <p>
            The Central Coast luxury market operates in the most exclusive tier of residential lending, where the pool of active lenders is small, qualification is complex, and the cost difference between optimal and suboptimal lender selection is measured in tens of thousands of dollars annually. Unlike markets where 50+ jumbo lenders compete, the super-jumbo space serving Montecito and Santa Barbara estate properties involves 10&ndash;15 specialized lenders with distinct products, rates, and qualification approaches.

            <strong>E-E-A-T Insight from Mo Abdel, NMLS #1426884:</strong> The Montecito and Santa Barbara luxury market is served by wealth management bankers who offer their institution&apos;s HELOC product alongside investment management services, creating a bundled relationship that may not deliver the best HELOC terms independently. As an independent wholesale broker, I have no investment management fees, no minimum asset requirements, and no incentive other than finding you the best HELOC terms available in the market. Montecito homeowners who compare my wholesale options against their private bank&apos;s HELOC consistently find more competitive rates, higher credit lines, or both.

          <h2 id="fire-rebuild" className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Fire-Rebuild Equity: Turning Disaster Recovery into Financial Opportunity</h2>
          <p>
            The Thomas Fire (December 2017) and subsequent debris flows devastated portions of Montecito and Santa Barbara, destroying hundreds of homes and causing billions in damage. Nearly a decade later, the fire-rebuild cycle has created a unique equity dynamic: homes rebuilt to modern California fire-resistant building codes with contemporary design, superior materials, and updated systems appraise 40&ndash;80% higher than pre-fire values. A Montecito home valued at $5M pre-fire that was rebuilt at a cost of $2M&ndash;$3M now appraises at $8M&ndash;$9M &mdash; the rebuild investment created $3M&ndash;$4M in new equity above the insurance payout and construction costs.
          </p>
          <p>
            This fire-rebuild equity represents an extraordinary wealth-building event for Central Coast homeowners who rebuilt rather than selling damaged parcels. Accessing this newly created equity through HELOCs allows homeowners to diversify their concentrated real estate wealth into investment portfolios, fund additional property acquisitions, or reinvest in estate improvements that further increase property value. The qualification consideration: fire-rebuild homes require lenders comfortable with California wildfire risk zones and the enhanced insurance requirements that come with fire-zone construction. Wholesale broker access identifies lenders who serve fire-zone properties without the premium rate adjustments that some institutional lenders apply.
