                <h2>What is investment property cash-out refinancing?</h2>
                <p>
                    Investment property cash-out refinancing replaces your existing rental property mortgage with a larger loan, providing the equity difference as cash. This strategy allows real estate investors to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fund new acquisitions</strong> - Use equity for down payments on additional properties</li>

                    <li><strong>Consolidate debt</strong> - Pay off higher-interest business or personal loans</li>

                    <li><strong>Diversify investments</strong> - Deploy capital into other asset classes</li>

                <h2>What are the requirements for investment property cash-out refinancing?</h2>

                <h3>Equity and LTV Requirements</h3>
                <p>
                    Investment properties have lower maximum LTVs than primary residences:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Single-family rentals:</strong> Up to 70-75% LTV</li>
                    <li><strong>2-4 unit properties:</strong> Up to 70% LTV</li>
                    <li><strong>DSCR loans:</strong> Up to 75-80% LTV with strong cash flow</li>
                    <li><strong>Portfolio loans:</strong> Varies by lender, typically 65-75%</li>
                </ul>

                    <li><strong>Conventional:</strong> 680+ (720+ for best pricing)</li>
                    <li><strong>DSCR:</strong> 660-680+ depending on lender</li>
                    <li><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Varies, some accept 640+</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Property Requirements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Typically 6+ months of ownership (seasoning)</li>
                    <li>Current lease in place or market rent documentation</li>
                    <li>Property in rentable condition</li>

                </ul>

                <h2>How does DSCR qualify for cash-out refinancing?</h2>
                <p>
                    DSCR loans use rental income instead of personal income for qualification:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>DSCR calculation:</strong> Monthly rent ÷ Monthly PITIA (Principal, Interest, Taxes, Insurance, HOA)</li>
                    <li><strong>1.0 DSCR:</strong> Rent exactly covers payment (break-even)</li>
                    <li><strong>1.25 DSCR:</strong> Rent is 25% higher than payment (positive cash flow)</li>
                    <li><strong>Higher DSCR:</strong> Better pricing and LTV options</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Example: Property with $3,000/month rent and $2,400/month PITIA has 1.25 DSCR.
                </p>

                <h3>DSCR Cash-Out Advantages</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li>No debt-to-income ratio calculation</li>
                    <li>Unlimited number of financed properties</li>
                    <li>Entity vesting (LLC, Corp) available</li>

                <h2>How do seasoning requirements affect investment property refinancing?</h2>
                <p>
                    Seasoning refers to how long you've owned the property:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Conventional:</strong> 6 months minimum for cash-out</li>
                    <li><strong>DSCR:</strong> Some lenders allow immediate cash-out, others require 3-6 months</li>
                    <li><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Varies by lender, some have no seasoning requirement</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Properties purchased below market value may require 12 months before using the higher appraised value.

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3>Can I do a cash-out refinance on an investment property?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes, cash-out refinancing is available for investment properties including single-family rentals, 2-4 unit properties, and larger multifamily buildings. Options include conventional loans (up to 10 financed properties), DSCR loans (no personal income verification), and portfolio loans for investors with larger holdings.
                </p>

                <h3>What is the maximum LTV for investment property cash-out refinance?</h3>
                <p>
                    Investment property cash-out refinances typically allow up to 70-75% LTV, lower than the 80% available for primary residences. Some DSCR lenders offer up to 75-80% LTV for properties with strong rental income. Maximum LTV decreases for 2-4 unit properties.
                </p>

                <h3>What is a DSCR cash-out refinance?</h3>
                <p>
                    DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio) loans qualify based on the property's rental income rather than the borrower's personal income. For cash-out refinances, the property's rent must typically cover 1.0-1.25x the mortgage payment. This is ideal for investors with multiple properties or complex income situations.
                </p>

                <h3>How many investment properties can I cash-out refinance?</h3>
                <p>
                    Conventional financing limits borrowers to 10 financed properties. DSCR and portfolio lenders have no property count limits, making them ideal for investors with larger portfolios. A wholesale broker can help identify lenders matching your portfolio size.
                </p>

                <h3>Can I use cash-out refinance proceeds to buy another investment property?</h3>
                <p>
                    Absolutely. Using equity from existing rentals to fund down payments on new acquisitions is a common portfolio growth strategy. This "velocity banking" approach allows investors to expand without needing to save separately for each property's down payment.
                </p>

                <h3>What credit score do I need for investment property cash-out refinance?</h3>
                <p>
                    Conventional investment property loans typically require 680+ credit scores. DSCR loans may accept scores as low as 660-680 depending on the lender and LTV. Higher scores qualify for better pricing and higher LTV options.
                </p>
