        <p>
          San Clemente&apos;s unique position as both a primary residence community and vacation destination creates diverse financing needs. The proximity to Camp Pendleton also brings VA loan demand. Wholesale broker access to specialized programs—jumbo, second home, VA—provides the flexibility San Clemente buyers need.
        </p>

        <h3>The San Clemente Second Home Market</h3>
        <p>
          San Clemente attracts vacation homebuyers from across Southern California and beyond. Buyers from Los Angeles, Inland Empire, and even out-of-state are drawn to the consistent surf, manageable crowds, and authentic beach town atmosphere. Second home financing requires specialized lenders who understand vacation property underwriting—a key wholesale broker advantage.
