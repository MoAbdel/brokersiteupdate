      question: 'Can you get a reverse mortgage on a $5 million home in Medina, WA?',
      answer: 'Yes. The FHA HECM program caps at $1,149,825, but proprietary jumbo reverse mortgage programs serve homes valued at $2 million to $10 million or more. Medina homeowners with estates above the HECM limit access significantly greater equity through these private-label programs available via wholesale broker channels.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the HECM limit for 2026 in Washington state?',
      answer: 'The 2026 FHA HECM lending limit is $1,149,825 nationwide. Since every ultra-luxury Eastside community has median home values well above this limit, most seniors need proprietary reverse mortgage programs to access meaningful equity from their homes.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Does Washington state tax reverse mortgage proceeds?',
      answer: 'No. Washington has no state income tax, making it one of the most favorable states for reverse mortgage borrowers. Reverse mortgage proceeds are loan advances, not income, so they are exempt from federal income tax as well.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do Washington property taxes affect reverse mortgage planning?',
      answer: 'Washington has no Proposition 13 equivalent, so property taxes are assessed at current market value and can increase annually. Reverse mortgage borrowers must continue paying property taxes. Higher property tax obligations in ultra-luxury communities make the reverse mortgage line of credit particularly valuable for covering these ongoing costs.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I get a reverse mortgage on a waterfront home on Lake Washington?',
      answer: 'Yes. Lake Washington waterfront properties in Medina, Hunts Point, Yarrow Point, and Mercer Island qualify for both HECM and proprietary reverse mortgages. Waterfront appraisals require specialized appraisers familiar with lakefront premium valuations.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens to a reverse mortgage when the homeowner passes away in Washington?',
      answer: 'Heirs have 12 months to sell, refinance, or pay off the balance. FHA HECM loans are non-recourse, meaning heirs never owe more than the home appraised value at the time of repayment. Washington community property laws may affect how the estate is handled.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Hunts Point too exclusive for reverse mortgage appraisals?',
      answer: 'No, but Hunts Point appraisals require MAI-designated appraisers experienced with ultra-exclusive communities. With only 42 homes in the community, comparable sales are extremely limited, requiring appraisers who understand paired-sales analysis using Medina, Yarrow Point, and Clyde Hill comparables.',
    },
  ];

  const faqData = [
    {
      question: 'What is the 2026 HECM limit and why does it matter for ultra-luxury Eastside homeowners?',
      answer: 'The 2026 HECM limit is $1,149,825, which represents the maximum home value used in FHA HECM calculations. For Medina ($5M+ median), Hunts Point ($3M+), Yarrow Point ($4.5M), Clyde Hill ($3M+), Beaux Arts Village ($2M), Mercer Island ($2.5M), and Bellevue ($1.5M+), this limit means the HECM only captures a fraction of actual home value. Proprietary jumbo reverse mortgages use the full appraised value, making them essential for ultra-luxury Eastside homeowners seeking meaningful equity access.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How much can a Medina homeowner access through a jumbo reverse mortgage?',
      answer: 'A Medina homeowner with a $5 million estate and no existing mortgage can access approximately $1.6 million to $2.5 million through proprietary jumbo reverse mortgage programs, depending on age, specific program, and current conditions. Estates valued at $8 million to $15 million access $2.6 million to $7.5 million. A standard HECM on the same property would only access approximately $520,000 to $600,000 because the FHA calculation caps at $1,149,825.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I get a reverse mortgage on a property held in a trust in Washington?',
      answer: 'Yes. Both HECM and proprietary reverse mortgages work with revocable living trusts, which are common estate planning vehicles for ultra-luxury Eastside properties. The trust must meet specific requirements: it must be revocable, the borrower must be the trustee and beneficiary, and the trust must allow encumbering the property. Irrevocable trusts require case-by-case review.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do Washington property taxes affect reverse mortgage borrowers compared to California?',
      answer: 'Washington has no Proposition 13 equivalent, meaning property taxes are assessed at current market value and can increase each year. A $5 million Medina estate may have property taxes of $35,000 to $50,000 annually. Reverse mortgage borrowers must continue paying property taxes. Many Eastside seniors use reverse mortgage proceeds specifically to cover these higher property tax obligations without depleting other retirement assets.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What types of properties qualify for jumbo reverse mortgages on the Eastside?',
      answer: 'Single-family residences, waterfront estates, gated-community homes, and properties on large lots all qualify. The property must serve as the borrower primary residence. Medina compounds, Hunts Point gated estates, Clyde Hill view properties, and Mercer Island waterfront homes all qualify. Condominiums in Bellevue also qualify if the project meets FHA or lender requirements.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Why is Washington state advantageous for reverse mortgage borrowers?',
      answer: 'Washington has no state income tax, which means reverse mortgage proceeds face zero state tax liability. Social Security benefits, pension income, and retirement distributions are also state-tax-free in Washington. This combination makes reverse mortgages particularly efficient for Washington seniors compared to states with income taxes, as the entire financial planning picture benefits from the no-income-tax environment.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What are the costs of a jumbo reverse mortgage on an ultra-luxury Eastside home?',
      answer: 'Proprietary jumbo reverse mortgage costs include origination fees ($6,000 to $25,000 depending on program and loan amount), appraisal fees ($2,500 to $7,500 for ultra-luxury properties requiring specialized appraisers), title insurance, and standard closing costs. No FHA mortgage insurance premium is required (unlike HECM), which reduces the upfront cost on high-value properties. Most costs can be financed into the loan.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does the reverse mortgage appraisal work for a Medina or Hunts Point estate?',
      answer: 'Ultra-luxury appraisals on the Eastside require MAI-designated appraisers with specific experience valuing $3 million to $15 million+ residential properties. The appraisal accounts for waterfront access, Lake Washington views, lot size, gated security, guest houses, docks, and premium landscaping. Comparable sales in communities like Hunts Point (42 homes) are extremely limited, requiring appraisers who understand cross-community paired-sales analysis.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can both spouses be on a reverse mortgage if one is under 62?',
      answer: 'For HECM, the borrowing spouse must be 62 or older. A younger non-borrowing spouse receives FHA protections allowing continued occupancy after the borrower passes. For proprietary jumbo programs, minimum age requirements vary by lender, with some programs accepting borrowers as young as 55. The older spouse age is used for calculation purposes, typically providing higher proceeds.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does a reverse mortgage take to close on an ultra-luxury Eastside property?',
      answer: 'Ultra-luxury reverse mortgages typically close in 60 to 90 days due to specialized appraisal requirements, trust review, and underwriting complexity. The timeline includes HUD counseling (1 to 2 weeks, required for HECM), MAI appraisal scheduling and completion (3 to 5 weeks), trust and estate document review (1 to 2 weeks), and underwriting and closing preparation (2 to 3 weeks).',
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if Eastside property values decline after taking a reverse mortgage?',
      answer: 'For HECM loans, the FHA non-recourse guarantee protects borrowers and heirs: you never owe more than the home value at repayment. For proprietary programs, most include non-recourse provisions, though terms vary by lender. Ultra-luxury Eastside values have demonstrated long-term resilience due to limited inventory, Lake Washington waterfront scarcity, and sustained demand from technology wealth creation in the Seattle metro area.',

          Why Ultra-Luxury Eastside Homeowners Need Jumbo Reverse Mortgages
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Seattle Eastside&apos;s ultra-luxury corridor along Lake Washington represents some of the highest-value residential real estate in the Pacific Northwest. When the median home in Medina exceeds $5 million and the HECM limit is $1,149,825, the FHA program accesses roughly 23% of the property&apos;s value for its calculation. For homeowners seeking meaningful liquidity from their estate, proprietary jumbo reverse mortgage programs bridge this gap by using the full appraised value&mdash;providing 3 to 8 times more proceeds than HECM alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Washington state&apos;s absence of a state income tax creates a uniquely favorable environment for reverse mortgage borrowers. Unlike California, where retirement distributions and investment income face state taxation, Washington seniors keep 100% of their retirement income and investment returns. Reverse mortgage proceeds&mdash;already exempt from federal income tax as loan advances&mdash;face zero state tax liability in Washington. This double tax advantage makes the Eastside an ideal location for reverse mortgage planning.

          Medina Reverse Mortgage: Billionaire Row &amp; Lake Washington Compounds
        </h2>
        <p>
          Medina stands as Washington state&apos;s wealthiest residential community, home to Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and a concentration of technology billionaires that makes this small city of approximately 3,200 residents one of the richest per-capita communities in the United States. With a median home value exceeding <strong>$5 million</strong> and lakefront estates reaching $50 million to $150 million, Medina represents the pinnacle of Pacific Northwest residential real estate.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Medina homeowners aged 62 and older, a proprietary jumbo reverse mortgage provides access to $1.6 million to $7.5 million+ on estates valued $5 million to $15 million&mdash;tax-free proceeds with no monthly mortgage payments, no requirement to sell the home, and zero Washington state income tax on the proceeds. The extreme privacy that defines Medina living remains completely intact throughout the reverse mortgage process.

          Clyde Hill Reverse Mortgage: Executive View Properties &amp; Tech Leadership Wealth
        </h2>
        <p>
          Clyde Hill occupies the highest elevation on the central Eastside, providing panoramic views of Lake Washington, the Seattle skyline, and the Olympic Mountains from properties that have attracted Microsoft and Amazon executives since the 1990s. With a median home value exceeding <strong>$3 million</strong>, Clyde Hill combines commanding views with proximity to downtown Bellevue and the SR-520 corridor connecting to Seattle.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Clyde Hill senior demographic reflects the community&apos;s history as an executive enclave: former Microsoft VPs, Amazon directors, and venture capital partners who purchased homes in the late 1990s through early 2010s at prices ranging from $800,000 to $2 million. These homes now appraise at $3 million to $6 million, representing 60% to 75% pure equity. Trust ownership is common, with family trusts holding properties intended for multi-generational use.

          Hunts Point Reverse Mortgage: Gated Peninsula Exclusivity&mdash;42 Homes
        </h2>
        <p>
          Hunts Point is Washington state&apos;s most exclusive residential community&mdash;a gated peninsula with approximately <strong>42 homes</strong> jutting into Lake Washington. With a median value exceeding <strong>$3 million</strong> and waterfront estates reaching $10 million to $20 million, Hunts Point represents extreme residential exclusivity. The community has no commercial properties, no through-traffic, and 24-hour private security at the single gated entry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reverse mortgage appraisals in Hunts Point present unique challenges due to the community&apos;s size. With only 42 homes and minimal turnover, comparable sales within Hunts Point itself are scarce. Appraisers must use paired-sales analysis incorporating Medina, Yarrow Point, and Clyde Hill waterfront sales, adjusting for Hunts Point&apos;s gated exclusivity premium. An experienced MAI appraiser who understands the Points Communities micro-market is essential for accurate valuation.

            <strong>Hunts Point Insight:</strong> A 74-year-old Hunts Point resident owns one of the peninsula&apos;s waterfront estates valued at $14 million. Annual property taxes exceed $98,000. Rather than selling the irreplaceable waterfront position, a proprietary jumbo reverse mortgage provides $4.6 million to $7 million in proceeds&mdash;enough to cover 50+ years of property taxes and maintenance while preserving the estate for heirs.

          Yarrow Point Reverse Mortgage: Points Communities Elite &amp; Lake Washington Frontage
        </h2>
        <p>
          Yarrow Point, with a <strong>$4.5 million</strong> median home value, occupies a prominent peninsula position within the Points Communities&mdash;the collective term for Hunts Point, Yarrow Point, and the surrounding waterfront enclaves. The community of approximately 1,000 residents features Lake Washington frontage properties, established neighborhoods with mature landscaping, and a quiet residential character that attracts tech executives and professionals who value proximity to Bellevue and Kirkland without the density.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yarrow Point&apos;s reverse mortgage landscape benefits from better comparable sales data than neighboring Hunts Point, with a larger housing stock and more regular transaction volume. Waterfront properties command significant premiums, with lakefront estates valued at $6 million to $12 million providing substantial jumbo reverse mortgage proceeds. Interior lots at $3 million to $5 million still far exceed the HECM limit, making proprietary programs the standard recommendation.

          Beaux Arts Village Reverse Mortgage: Artist Colony Charm &amp; Lakefront Legacy
        </h2>
        <p>
          Beaux Arts Village is one of Washington&apos;s smallest and most distinctive communities&mdash;approximately <strong>50 homes</strong> on 37 acres along the southeastern shore of Lake Washington. Founded in 1908 as an artist colony, the Village maintains a bohemian character with winding paths, communal lakefront access, and architectural diversity ranging from original early-century craftsman homes to contemporary renovations. The <strong>$2 million</strong> median reflects the premium placed on community exclusivity, Lake Washington access, and the Village&apos;s irreplaceable character.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beaux Arts Village homeowners aged 62+ face a unique reverse mortgage consideration: the community&apos;s small size (50 homes) creates limited comparable sales, similar to Hunts Point. Appraisers must understand the Village&apos;s communal land ownership structure, private beach access rights, and the premium placed on the artistic community character. These factors add value that generic appraisers may miss, potentially reducing reverse mortgage proceeds.

        <p>
          Mercer Island&apos;s <strong>$2.5 million</strong> median home value reflects its unique position as the largest inhabited island in Lake Washington, connected to Seattle and Bellevue by I-90. The island&apos;s 25,000 residents enjoy a self-contained community with excellent schools, waterfront parks, a downtown village, and a residential character that combines suburban space with urban accessibility. Long-term homeowners who purchased in the 1980s and 1990s hold equity positions of $1.5 million to $4 million on properties that have appreciated consistently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mercer Island&apos;s reverse mortgage landscape offers broader appraisal support than the Points Communities, with a larger housing stock generating regular transaction data. Waterfront properties on the north and east shores command $4 million to $8 million, while interior homes in the First Hill, Island Crest, and South End neighborhoods range from $1.5 million to $3.5 million. The island&apos;s geographic constraint&mdash;no new land can be created&mdash;provides fundamental value support for reverse mortgage lending.

          Bellevue&apos;s emergence as the Eastside&apos;s urban center&mdash;with a downtown skyline featuring luxury high-rise condominiums, Amazon&apos;s second headquarters, Meta&apos;s regional campus, and Google&apos;s expanded offices&mdash;has pushed the median home value above <strong>$1.5 million</strong>.

          Why Ultra-Luxury Eastside Homeowners Need a Specialist Reverse Mortgage Broker
        </h2>
        <p>
          The ultra-luxury reverse mortgage market on the Seattle Eastside operates in a specialized tier where standard HECM originators lack the product access and market knowledge to serve clients effectively. When a Medina estate is worth $8 million or a Hunts Point compound exceeds $15 million, the broker must understand proprietary jumbo reverse mortgage products from multiple lenders, coordinate MAI appraisers experienced with waterfront and gated-community valuations, and navigate trust structures that are standard for this wealth level.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Mo Abdel (NMLS #1426884)</strong> provides ultra-luxury Eastside homeowners with access to multiple proprietary jumbo reverse mortgage lenders through <strong>Lumin Lending (NMLS #2716106, DRE #02291443)</strong>. This multi-lender access ensures competitive comparison: proprietary jumbo products vary significantly in maximum home value, proceeds percentage, trust compatibility, and minimum age requirements. Comparing three to five jumbo reverse mortgage offers side-by-side identifies the optimal program for each estate&apos;s specific characteristics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Washington&apos;s no-income-tax environment adds a strategic dimension that California-focused brokers may overlook. The interplay between reverse mortgage proceeds, property tax obligations (without Prop 13 protection), and Washington&apos;s community property laws requires a broker who understands both states&apos; regulatory frameworks. Mo Abdel, licensed in both California and Washington, brings this dual-state expertise to every ultra-luxury Eastside consultation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The appraisal is the single most critical factor in ultra-luxury reverse mortgage proceeds. A $5 million Medina estate that appraises at $4.2 million due to an inexperienced appraiser reduces available proceeds by $260,000 to $400,000. Mo coordinates with MAI-designated appraisers who have documented experience valuing $3 million to $15 million+ Eastside properties, ensuring accurate valuations that capture waterfront premiums, view adjustments, gated-community factors, and the scarcity pricing that defines ultra-luxury Eastside real estate.

          All seven ultra-luxury Eastside communities appreciated 43% to 47% over the 2020&ndash;2026 period. Unlike California, Washington property taxes adjust annually to reflect current market values&mdash;there is no Proposition 13 cap. This means property tax obligations grow alongside appreciation, making the reverse mortgage line of credit an increasingly important tool for covering these escalating costs without depleting retirement savings.

            Expert Summary: Ultra-Luxury Eastside Reverse Mortgage Advantage
          </h2>
          <p className="text-blue-800 mb-4">
            Ultra-luxury Eastside homeowners in Medina, Clyde Hill, Hunts Point, Yarrow Point, Beaux Arts Village, Mercer Island, and Bellevue hold an estimated $38 billion in residential real estate&mdash;estates where the standard HECM captures a fraction of actual value. Proprietary jumbo reverse mortgages unlock $650,000 to $7.5 million+ in tax-free proceeds from these estates, providing meaningful liquidity without selling the home or triggering capital gains.
          </p>
          <p className="text-blue-800 mb-4">
            Washington&apos;s zero state income tax creates a double advantage: reverse mortgage proceeds face no federal or state income tax. However, without Proposition 13 property tax protection, Eastside property taxes are assessed at current market value and rise annually. The reverse mortgage line of credit provides a strategic buffer against these escalating property tax obligations.
