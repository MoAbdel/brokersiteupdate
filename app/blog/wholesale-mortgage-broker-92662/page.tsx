            Balboa Island 92662 represents one of Newport Beach&apos;s most coveted addresses with a <strong>$4.0 million median home price</strong> on extremely limited island real estate. When the 2026 conforming limit of $1,149,825 covers barely 29% of the typical purchase, you need a <strong>wholesale mortgage broker</strong> with jumbo and second home expertise—not a bank with a single product. Our access to 200+ lenders delivers <strong>better rates than Wells Fargo Private Bank or First Republic</strong> for Balboa Island buyers.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why Balboa Island Homebuyers Choose Wholesale</h2>

        <h3>The 92662 Market Reality</h3>
        <p>
          Balboa Island presents distinct financing challenges that separate wholesale brokers from traditional banks:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Premium island real estate:</strong> Limited land drives prices from $2.5M to $10M+</li>
          <li><strong>Second home demand:</strong> Many buyers purchase vacation properties requiring specialized financing</li>
          <li><strong>Waterfront premiums:</strong> Bayfront and oceanfront homes command significant price premiums</li>
          <li><strong>Older home stock:</strong> Historic cottages and older builds require lenders comfortable with vintage properties</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Second Home Financing Edge</h3>
        <p>
          Balboa Island attracts buyers from Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Diego seeking a Newport Beach second home. Banks often restrict second home jumbo products or add rate premiums. A wholesale broker accesses <strong>multiple lenders actively competing for second home business</strong>, often at rates comparable to primary residence financing.
