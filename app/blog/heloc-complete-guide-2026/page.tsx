                        A HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit) lets you access your home's equity without refinancing your existing mortgage. In 2026, homeowners with substantial equity can tap into credit lines from $50,000 to $500,000+ through wholesale brokers who compare rates from 50+ lenders to find competitive pricing for your situation.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2>What is a HELOC and how does it work in 2026?</h2>
                <p>
                    A HELOC functions as a revolving line of credit secured by your home's equity. Unlike a cash-out refinance that replaces your first mortgage, a HELOC sits in second position, preserving your existing loan terms:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Draw period</strong> - Typically 10 years to access funds as needed</li>
                    <li><strong>Interest-only payments</strong> - Pay only on what you borrow during draw period</li>
                    <li><strong>Repayment period</strong> - 10-20 years to repay principal and interest</li>
                    <li><strong>Variable rates</strong> - Tied to prime rate plus margin</li>
                    <li><strong>Revolving access</strong> - Reuse available credit as you pay down</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why choose a HELOC over cash-out refinancing?</h2>
                <p>
                    HELOCs make sense in several key situations:
                </p>

                <h3>Preserve Your Low First Mortgage Rate</h3>
                <p>
                    If you secured a first mortgage at 3-4% during 2020-2021, a HELOC lets you access equity without sacrificing that favorable rate. Refinancing would replace it with current rates.
                </p>

                <h3>Flexible Access to Funds</h3>
                <p>
                    Unlike a lump sum from refinancing, HELOCs let you draw funds as needed. Ideal for:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ongoing home renovation projects</li>
                    <li>Business expenses that arise over time</li>
                    <li>Emergency reserves you may not need</li>
                    <li>Education costs spread across semesters</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Lower Closing Costs</h3>
                <p>
                    HELOCs typically have lower closing costs than full refinances. Many lenders offer no-closing-cost HELOCs for qualified borrowers.
                </p>

                <h2>How do I qualify for a HELOC in 2026?</h2>
                <p>
                    HELOC qualification involves several factors:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Equity</strong> - Minimum 15-20% equity after HELOC (80-85% max CLTV)</li>
                    <li><strong>Credit Score</strong> - 680+ for most lenders, 720+ for best rates</li>
                    <li><strong>Debt-to-Income</strong> - Generally 43-50% maximum including HELOC payment</li>
                    <li><strong>Income Verification</strong> - W-2s, tax returns, or alternative documentation</li>
                    <li><strong>Property Type</strong> - Primary residence, second home, or investment</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3>What is a HELOC and how does it work?</h3>
                <p>
                    A HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit) is a revolving credit line secured by your home's equity. You can draw funds as needed during the draw period (typically 10 years), paying interest only on what you borrow. It works like a credit card backed by your home.
                </p>

                <h3>How much can I borrow with a HELOC in 2026?</h3>
                <p>
                    Most lenders allow combined loan-to-value (CLTV) up to 80-90% of your home's value. For example, a $1 million home with a $500,000 mortgage could qualify for a HELOC up to $300,000-$400,000, depending on the lender and your qualifications.
                </p>

                <h3>What credit score is needed for a HELOC?</h3>
                <p>
                    Most HELOC lenders require 680+ credit scores for approval, with 720+ securing the best rates. Some lenders offer HELOCs to borrowers with 620+ scores with higher rates or lower credit limits.
                </p>

                <h3>Is HELOC interest tax deductible?</h3>
                <p>
                    HELOC interest may be tax deductible if funds are used to buy, build, or substantially improve your home. Interest on funds used for other purposes like debt consolidation is generally not deductible. Consult a tax advisor for your specific situation.
                </p>

                <h3>What's the difference between a HELOC and home equity loan?</h3>
                <p>
                    A HELOC is a revolving credit line with variable rates and flexible draws. A home equity loan (HELOAN) provides a lump sum with fixed rates and payments. HELOCs offer flexibility while HELOANs provide payment predictability.
