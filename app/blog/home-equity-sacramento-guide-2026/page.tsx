If your existing mortgage rate is above current market rates, a cash-out refinance replaces your mortgage with a new loan at a potentially lower rate while providing equity access.

Most Sacramento homeowners with mortgages originated in 2020-2021 at rates below 4% prefer HELOCs."

          <p className="text-gray-800 mb-0">
            Sacramento and Gold Country homeowners hold an estimated <strong>$22 billion in collective home equity</strong> across five affluent communities. Granite Bay leads with a median home value of <strong>$1.1 million</strong>, followed by El Dorado Hills at <strong>$955,000</strong>, Davis at <strong>$850,000</strong>, Folsom at <strong>$760,000</strong>, and Roseville at <strong>$650,000</strong>. HELOC rates in February 2026 range from <strong>7.25% to 9.50% APR</strong> through wholesale channels, while cash-out refinance rates sit between <strong>6.75% and 7.50%</strong> for qualified borrowers. The Sacramento region benefits from two distinct equity sources: decades of state government pension wealth accumulation and massive Bay Area transplant equity. As a wholesale mortgage broker with access to over 200 lenders, I help Sacramento-area homeowners compare HELOC, HELOAN, and cash-out refinance products from multiple providers simultaneously, ensuring the most competitive rates and lowest fees for every property profile.

        {/* Introduction */}
        <h2>Why Sacramento Is a Prime Home Equity Market in 2026</h2>
        <p>
          The Sacramento metropolitan region has experienced a 68% increase in median home values over the past seven years, driven by Bay Area migration, infrastructure investment, and the diversification of the Capital Region economy beyond state government. For homeowners who purchased in El Dorado Hills, Granite Bay, Folsom, Roseville, or Davis before 2020, this appreciation has created equity positions that provide significant financial flexibility through home equity products.
        </p>
        <p>
          A CalPERS retiree who purchased a Roseville home in 2010 for $320,000 now holds a property worth $650,000 &mdash; over $330,000 in appreciation alone. A UC Davis professor who bought in Davis in 2005 for $425,000 sits on $850,000 in current value. A Bay Area transplant who paid $880,000 for an El Dorado Hills home in 2019 now holds $955,000 in value with only six years of ownership. Each of these homeowners can access substantial equity through HELOC, HELOAN, or cash-out refinance products tailored to their specific needs and financial situations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Capital Region also offers a favorable environment for home equity borrowing because of its relatively stable property tax structure under Proposition 13, strong employment fundamentals anchored by state government and UC Davis Health, and a cost of living that remains well below coastal California. These factors combine to create a market where homeowners have both the equity to borrow against and the income stability to manage equity-based debt responsibly.
        </p>

        {/* 5-City Table */}
        <h2>Sacramento Home Equity Overview: 5-City Comparison [2026]</h2>
        <p>
          Understanding the equity landscape across five Sacramento-area cities helps homeowners identify which products offer the greatest advantage for their specific property and financial situation. Granite Bay&apos;s high values create jumbo HELOC opportunities, while Roseville&apos;s more moderate values align with standard conforming products that often carry lower rates.

        <h2>HELOC vs. HELOAN vs. Cash-Out Refinance: Sacramento Product Comparison</h2>
        <p>
          Sacramento-area homeowners have three primary options for accessing home equity. Each product serves different financial objectives, and the right choice depends on your current mortgage rate, the purpose of the funds, and your preference for fixed versus variable payments. Understanding the structural differences helps you select the product that minimizes total borrowing cost while meeting your specific needs.

        <h2>Government Employee Qualification Advantages for Sacramento HELOCs</h2>
        <p>
          Sacramento&apos;s concentration of current and retired state government employees creates a unique HELOC qualification environment. CalPERS pension income, state salary stability, and government employment history produce borrower profiles that lenders view as exceptionally low risk. This translates into tangible advantages during the qualification and underwriting process.
        </p>

        <h3>CalPERS Pension Income as HELOC Qualification Income</h3>
        <p>
          CalPERS pension income is treated as stable, recurring income by all major HELOC lenders. Unlike self-employment income that requires two years of tax returns and averaging calculations, CalPERS pension income is verified through a benefit statement showing the monthly amount. This simplified documentation streamlines the application and reduces underwriting timelines. A retired state employee receiving $5,500 per month from CalPERS combined with $2,800 in Social Security presents $8,300 in documented monthly income &mdash; more than sufficient to qualify for a substantial HELOC on a Sacramento-area property.
        </p>
        <p>
          Active state employees also benefit from employment stability. A current Department of Finance analyst with 15 years of state service demonstrates the type of employment continuity that underwriters value. State employment carries no risk of layoff comparable to private sector positions, and annual salary increases through collective bargaining agreements provide predictable income growth that strengthens qualification ratios.

        {/* Bay Area Transplant Strategies */}
        <h2>Bay Area Transplant Equity Strategies: Maximizing Your Sacramento Investment</h2>
        <p>
          The migration of Bay Area professionals to Sacramento&apos;s suburbs created a unique cohort of equity-rich homeowners who purchased properties with large down payments or all cash between 2018 and 2023. These transplants sold homes in San Francisco, San Jose, Walnut Creek, and other coastal cities at premium prices and redeployed that equity into Sacramento-area properties at a fraction of the cost. The result: homeowners with 50% to 100% equity positions on day one, plus appreciation gains since purchase.
        </p>

        <h3>Strategy 1: The HELOC Reserve for Early Retirees</h3>
        <p>
          Bay Area transplants who retired early to Sacramento often lack the traditional pension income that government retirees enjoy. Instead, they manage investment portfolios, rental income from retained Bay Area properties, and savings drawdowns. A HELOC provides a flexible credit reserve that supplements portfolio withdrawals during market downturns, preventing forced sales of investments at depressed prices. A retired tech executive in El Dorado Hills with $955,000 in home equity and a $2 million investment portfolio establishes a $300,000 HELOC as a strategic buffer, drawing on the credit line during bear markets and repaying during recoveries. This approach preserves portfolio value while maintaining lifestyle spending.
        </p>

        <h3>Strategy 2: Investment Property Acquisition via Cash-Out</h3>
        <p>
          Some Bay Area transplants use Sacramento home equity to fund investment property purchases. A cash-out refinance on a $1.1 million Granite Bay home with no existing mortgage provides $770,000 to $880,000 in proceeds at a first-lien rate (lower than HELOC rates). These funds serve as down payments on multiple investment properties in Sacramento&apos;s rental-heavy markets, effectively leveraging primary-residence equity into income-producing real estate. This strategy requires careful debt-to-income management and a clear investment plan.
        </p>

        <h3>Strategy 3: ADU Construction for Rental Income</h3>
        <p>
          California&apos;s ADU (Accessory Dwelling Unit) laws make it straightforward to build a rental unit on most Sacramento-area residential properties. A HELOC provides the ideal financing mechanism for ADU construction because funds are drawn as construction progresses rather than borrowing the full amount upfront. A $150,000 to $250,000 ADU on a Folsom or Roseville property can generate $1,800 to $2,500 per month in rental income, effectively servicing the HELOC interest payments while building equity in the accessory unit. El Dorado Hills and Granite Bay estate properties with large lots offer even greater ADU potential.

          <p>
            These five cities form the affluent core of the Sacramento region&apos;s home equity market. Equity access strategies differ based on property values, existing mortgage rates, and homeowner objectives. Understanding the local dynamics in each city helps identify the optimal equity product.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Granite Bay ($1.1M median):</strong> The highest equity concentration in the Sacramento region. Estate properties on large lots create jumbo HELOC and high-balance cash-out refinance opportunities. Los Lagos and Quarry Ponds homeowners who purchased before 2015 typically hold $700,000+ in accessible equity. Jumbo HELOC products from wholesale lenders accommodate the higher balances common in this market.</li>
            <li><strong>El Dorado Hills ($955K median):</strong> Strong equity growth driven by Bay Area transplant demand. Serrano community homes purchased in 2015-2018 have appreciated 40-60%, creating $300,000 to $500,000 in new equity. HELOC products are popular for home improvements and financial reserves, while cash-out refinancing serves homeowners seeking to consolidate higher-rate debt.</li>
            <li><strong>Davis ($850K median):</strong> The university town&apos;s stable values and long-term ownership patterns create exceptional equity positions. Retired UC Davis faculty who purchased 20-30 years ago hold $500,000+ in equity on homes now worth $850,000. HELOCs serve academic retirees who want flexible access without disturbing existing low-rate first mortgages.</li>
            <li><strong>Folsom ($760K median):</strong> Historic Folsom character homes and Empire Ranch planned community properties provide solid equity foundations. State employees who bought in the 2000s hold $380,000 to $550,000 in equity. HELOC products for kitchen and bath remodels are the most common request from Folsom homeowners looking to update 15- to 20-year-old homes.</li>
            <li><strong>Roseville ($650K median):</strong> The largest Placer County city offers accessible equity for a broad range of homeowners. Sun City retirees, young families in West Roseville, and state workers in Highland Reserve all hold meaningful equity positions. Standard conforming HELOC products carry the most competitive rates for Roseville&apos;s value range.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-0">
            Homeowners across these five cities can access <strong>$250,000 to $900,000+</strong> in equity depending on property value, existing mortgage balance, and loan-to-value preferences.

        {/* Common Use Cases */}
        <h2>Top Home Equity Use Cases for Sacramento Homeowners</h2>
        <p>
          Sacramento-area homeowners access home equity for a variety of purposes. The most financially productive uses fall into categories that either increase property value, reduce total interest costs, or create future income streams. Here are the five most common use cases across the Capital Region.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Home Renovation &amp; Remodeling</h3>
        <p>
          Kitchen and bath remodels, whole-home updates, and outdoor living improvements represent the most popular HELOC use case in Sacramento. Folsom and Roseville homes built in the early 2000s are now 20+ years old, and strategic renovations both improve daily livability and increase resale value. A $75,000 kitchen remodel on a $760,000 Folsom home can increase property value by $50,000 to $65,000 while dramatically improving the homeowner&apos;s quality of life. HELOC financing is ideal because contractors invoice in stages, allowing homeowners to draw funds as work progresses.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Debt Consolidation</h3>
        <p>
          Consolidating high-interest credit card debt, auto loans, and personal loans into a HELOC or HELOAN at a lower rate reduces monthly payments and total interest cost. A Sacramento homeowner carrying $45,000 in credit card debt at 22% APR saves approximately $6,750 in annual interest by consolidating into a HELOC at 7.5% APR. The key discipline is avoiding new high-interest debt after consolidation. This strategy works particularly well for homeowners with strong equity positions who have accumulated consumer debt during periods of high inflation.
        </p>

        <h3>3. ADU Construction &amp; Rental Income</h3>
        <p>
          California&apos;s progressive ADU legislation makes Sacramento one of the most attractive markets for accessory dwelling unit construction. A HELOC provides construction financing flexibility, and the completed ADU generates rental income that services the equity debt. Roseville and Folsom properties with standard lot sizes accommodate detached ADUs of 800 to 1,200 square feet, while Granite Bay and El Dorado Hills estate lots support larger guest house-style ADUs. Rental income from Sacramento-area ADUs ranges from $1,500 to $2,500 per month, depending on size, location, and finish quality.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Education Funding</h3>
        <p>
          Davis homeowners near UC Davis and families across the Sacramento region use home equity to fund college education costs. HELOC interest rates are typically lower than Parent PLUS federal loan rates (currently 8.05%) and private student loan rates. A $150,000 HELOC draw for four years of university tuition at 7.5% APR costs significantly less than the equivalent Parent PLUS loan at 8.05% APR, saving thousands in interest over the repayment period.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Investment Property Down Payments</h3>
        <p>
          Sacramento&apos;s strong rental market attracts homeowners seeking to build investment portfolios using primary-residence equity. A cash-out refinance or large HELOC draw provides down payment funds for investment property purchases without liquidating retirement accounts or investment portfolios. A Granite Bay homeowner who extracts $250,000 through a cash-out refinance can put 25% down on a $1 million investment property, creating a rental income stream that covers the equity debt service and builds long-term wealth.

        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl border border-gray-200 mb-6">
          <p>
            As a licensed mortgage broker (NMLS #1426884) with Lumin Lending, Inc. (NMLS #2716106, DRE #02291443), I bring wholesale market access and deep understanding of Sacramento&apos;s real estate dynamics to every home equity consultation. Here is what sets my approach apart:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>200+ lender access:</strong> I compare HELOC, HELOAN, and cash-out refinance products from dozens of wholesale lenders simultaneously. This competition produces lower rates and reduced fees compared to walking into a single bank or credit union.</li>
            <li><strong>Sacramento market expertise:</strong> I understand the nuances of Capital Region real estate, from Granite Bay estate valuations to Sun City Roseville active-adult dynamics. Accurate property assessment ensures your equity access matches your home&apos;s true value.</li>
            <li><strong>Government retiree specialization:</strong> Sacramento&apos;s CalPERS concentration requires a broker who understands how pension income, deferred compensation, and retiree healthcare benefits interact with HELOC qualification requirements. I streamline the documentation process for government retirees.</li>
            <li><strong>Strategic product matching:</strong> Rather than pushing a single product, I analyze your current mortgage rate, equity position, and financial objectives to recommend the product that minimizes total borrowing cost. Sometimes a HELOC is optimal; other times a cash-out refinance saves more. The analysis determines the recommendation.</li>
            <li><strong>Licensed in California and Washington:</strong> For Sacramento families with properties in both states, I coordinate equity strategies across state lines with consistent service and competitive wholesale pricing.</li>

        {/* Rate Environment */}
        <h2>Sacramento HELOC &amp; Home Equity Rate Environment [February 2026]</h2>
        <p>
          The interest rate environment in February 2026 shapes the product selection decision for Sacramento homeowners. Understanding the rate landscape across product types helps identify the most cost-effective path to equity access.
        </p>
        <p>
          HELOC rates are tied to the Prime Rate plus a margin determined by the lender based on your credit score, LTV ratio, and property type. As of February 2026, the Prime Rate stands at 8.50%, and competitive wholesale HELOC margins range from -1.25% to +1.00%, producing effective rates of 7.25% to 9.50% APR for qualified borrowers. Homeowners with credit scores above 740 and combined LTVs below 70% access the lowest rates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cash-out refinance rates for conventional loans in February 2026 range from 6.75% to 7.50% for 30-year fixed terms. These rates are lower than HELOC rates because cash-out refinancing creates a first-lien position (lower risk for the lender). However, the cash-out refinance replaces your existing first mortgage, so homeowners with current rates below 4% (originated 2020-2021) lose their favorable rate if they refinance. This is why most Sacramento homeowners with sub-4% first mortgages choose HELOCs that preserve the low first-lien rate.
        </p>
        <p>
          HELOAN (fixed-rate home equity loan) rates in February 2026 range from 7.50% to 9.75% APR. HELOANs appeal to Sacramento homeowners who want the predictability of fixed monthly payments and have a specific one-time expense. The slightly higher rate compared to HELOC reflects the fixed-rate premium that protects against future rate increases.

        {/* Common Concerns */}
        <h2>Addressing Common Sacramento Home Equity Concerns</h2>

        <h3>&ldquo;I don&apos;t want to risk my home.&rdquo;</h3>
        <p>
          A HELOC or home equity loan is secured by your property, which means the lender can foreclose if you default on payments. However, responsible borrowing within your income capacity eliminates this risk. The key is borrowing only what you can service through monthly payments. CalPERS retirees with stable pension income and homeowners with secure state employment face minimal risk when HELOC draws remain within conservative limits. I help Sacramento clients calculate comfortable borrowing levels before application, ensuring monthly payments align with their budget and income.
        </p>

        <h3>&ldquo;Interest rates are too high right now.&rdquo;</h3>
        <p>
          Current HELOC rates of 7.25% to 9.50% are higher than the historically low rates of 2020-2021, but they remain competitive for equity access. Consider the context: credit card rates average 22% APR, personal loan rates average 12-15% APR, and Parent PLUS student loans charge 8.05%. A HELOC at 7.5% is significantly cheaper than these alternatives. Additionally, HELOC rates are variable and will decrease when the Federal Reserve cuts rates. Many Sacramento homeowners establish HELOCs now to lock in access, then benefit from lower rates as monetary policy shifts.
        </p>

        <h3>&ldquo;I already have a low mortgage rate I don&apos;t want to lose.&rdquo;</h3>
        <p>
          This is precisely why HELOCs exist as a distinct product. A HELOC sits in second lien position behind your existing first mortgage, preserving your low rate. A Folsom homeowner with a 3.25% first mortgage originated in 2021 keeps that rate intact while accessing equity through a HELOC. Only homeowners with first mortgage rates above current market rates (above 7%) should consider cash-out refinancing, which replaces the first mortgage entirely. I analyze your current rate environment and recommend the product structure that minimizes your total interest cost across all liens.
        </p>

        <h3>&ldquo;How do I know which product is right?&rdquo;</h3>
        <p>
          The product selection framework is straightforward. If you have a low first mortgage rate and need flexible, ongoing access to funds, choose a HELOC. If you have a low first rate and need a one-time fixed amount, choose a HELOAN. If your first mortgage rate is above current market rates and you need equity access, choose a cash-out refinance that simultaneously lowers your first-lien rate and provides equity funds. I provide a side-by-side cost analysis during our consultation that makes the optimal choice clear based on your specific numbers.

            <p>Sacramento HELOC rates in February 2026 range from approximately 7.25% to 9.50% APR for variable-rate products, depending on credit score, loan-to-value ratio, and lender.

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">How much equity can I access in my El Dorado Hills home?</h3>
            <p>El Dorado Hills homeowners can typically access up to 80-90% of their home&apos;s value minus any existing mortgage balance. With a median home value of $955,000, a homeowner with a $300,000 remaining mortgage could access $464,000 to $559,500 in equity, depending on credit profile and the specific product chosen.</p>

          <div className="border-b border-gray-200 pb-4">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">What is the difference between a HELOC and a HELOAN for Sacramento homeowners?</h3>
            <p>A HELOC provides a revolving credit line with variable interest rates, allowing you to draw funds as needed during the draw period (typically 10 years). A HELOAN provides a one-time lump sum at a fixed interest rate with predictable monthly payments. Sacramento homeowners who need flexibility for ongoing projects prefer HELOCs, while those with a specific one-time expense prefer HELOANs.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="border-b border-gray-200 pb-4">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Do CalPERS government retirees qualify for HELOCs in Sacramento?</h3>
            <p>Yes. CalPERS pension income counts as qualifying income for HELOC applications. Retired state government employees with stable monthly pension income, strong credit scores, and substantial home equity are excellent candidates. Lenders view CalPERS pensions as highly reliable income because they are backed by the state of California.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="border-b border-gray-200 pb-4">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Can I use a HELOC for home renovations in Granite Bay?</h3>
            <p>Yes, HELOCs are one of the most popular financing tools for home renovations. Granite Bay homeowners frequently use HELOCs for kitchen and bath remodels, pool construction, ADU additions, and landscaping on estate-sized lots. The revolving credit line structure allows you to draw funds as contractor invoices arrive.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="border-b border-gray-200 pb-4">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">What credit score do I need for a Sacramento HELOC?</h3>
            <p>Most lenders require a minimum credit score of 680 for HELOC approval, with the best rates reserved for scores above 740. Some wholesale lenders offer products with scores as low as 620. Sacramento homeowners with strong credit and substantial equity qualify for the most competitive wholesale pricing available.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="border-b border-gray-200 pb-4">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Is a cash-out refinance better than a HELOC for Sacramento homeowners?</h3>
            <p>It depends on your current mortgage rate. If your existing rate is above current market rates (above 7%), a cash-out refinance replaces your mortgage at a potentially lower rate while providing equity access. If your rate is below 4% (originated 2020-2021), a HELOC preserves your low-rate first mortgage while accessing equity through a second lien. Most Sacramento homeowners with sub-4% first mortgages choose HELOCs.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="border-b border-gray-200 pb-4">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">How long does it take to get a HELOC in the Sacramento area?</h3>
            <p>HELOC approval and funding typically takes 2-4 weeks in the Sacramento region. The process includes application, credit review, property appraisal (some lenders accept automated valuations), underwriting, and closing. Working with a wholesale broker who submits to multiple lenders simultaneously can accelerate the timeline.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="border-b border-gray-200 pb-4">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Can Bay Area transplants in Sacramento access equity on recently purchased homes?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Bay Area transplants who purchased Sacramento-area homes in 2019-2022 have already seen significant appreciation. Most lenders require 6-12 months of ownership before approving a HELOC, and some waive this seasoning requirement for borrowers with strong credit and low LTV ratios.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="border-b border-gray-200 pb-4">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Are HELOC interest payments tax-deductible for Sacramento homeowners?</h3>
            <p>HELOC interest is tax-deductible when the funds are used to buy, build, or substantially improve the home securing the loan, per IRS guidelines. Funds used for debt consolidation, tuition, or other purposes are generally not deductible. Consult a tax professional for your specific situation.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="border-b border-gray-200 pb-4">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">What is the maximum HELOC amount available for Granite Bay homes?</h3>
            <p>Granite Bay HELOC amounts depend on home value, existing mortgage, and lender limits. With a median of $1.1 million, a homeowner with no existing mortgage could access up to $880,000 to $990,000 at 80-90% LTV. Most wholesale lenders cap individual HELOCs at $500,000 to $1 million, though some jumbo products go higher.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="border-b border-gray-200 pb-4">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Can I get a HELOC on my Davis home near UC Davis?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Davis homes qualify for HELOCs, HELOANs, and cash-out refinancing. With Davis median values at $850,000, homeowners with moderate to no existing mortgage debt hold substantial equity. Retired UC Davis faculty with pension income and strong credit profiles are particularly strong HELOC candidates.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="border-b border-gray-200 pb-4">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">What fees are involved in a Sacramento HELOC?</h3>
            <p>HELOC fees vary by lender but typically include an appraisal fee ($400-$600), title search, and annual maintenance fee ($50-$100). Many wholesale lenders offer no-closing-cost HELOCs where fees are waived or credited. Comparing multiple lender offers through a wholesale broker ensures the lowest total cost for your Sacramento-area property.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="border-b border-gray-200 pb-4">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Why should I use a wholesale broker for my Sacramento home equity loan?</h3>
            <p>A wholesale broker accesses HELOC, HELOAN, and cash-out refinance products from 200+ lenders simultaneously. This competition produces lower rates, reduced fees, and more flexible qualification criteria compared to working with a single bank. For Sacramento homeowners comparing complex equity options, a wholesale broker provides comprehensive comparison shopping in a single consultation.</p>

          <h2 className="mt-0 text-xl font-bold text-green-900">Expert Summary: Home Equity in the Sacramento &amp; Gold Country Region [2026]</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-800">
            The Sacramento and Gold Country region offers one of Northern California&apos;s strongest home equity markets, with five affluent cities providing $650,000 to $1.1 million in median property values and billions in collective accessible equity. Two powerful wealth drivers shape this market: decades of CalPERS pension accumulation by state government retirees and the massive Bay Area transplant migration that brought coastal equity to Capital Region suburbs. The result is a homeowner demographic with high equity, stable income, and strong motivation to access that equity for renovation, debt consolidation, ADU construction, and retirement planning.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-800">
            Product selection in the current rate environment hinges on your existing first mortgage rate. Homeowners with sub-4% rates originated in 2020-2021 preserve that favorable rate through HELOC products in second lien position. Homeowners with rates above current market levels benefit from cash-out refinancing that simultaneously lowers their first-lien rate and provides equity access. In every case, working with a wholesale broker who compares products from 200+ lenders ensures Sacramento homeowners receive the most competitive rates and lowest fees available.
