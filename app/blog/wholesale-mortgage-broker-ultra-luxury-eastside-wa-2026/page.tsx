    {
      question: 'What is a wholesale mortgage broker and how does it benefit ultra-luxury Eastside buyers?',
      answer: 'A wholesale mortgage broker accesses 200+ lenders that do not work directly with consumers. For ultra-luxury Eastside buyers financing $3M-$20M+ properties, this means comparing jumbo, bank statement, DSCR, and foreign national programs across dozens of specialized lenders instead of relying on a single bank. Wholesale rates run 0.25-0.75% below retail on jumbo products because lenders compete for broker-submitted files.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I get a $10 million mortgage on a Medina estate through a wholesale broker?',
      answer: 'Yes. Wholesale brokers access institutional jumbo lenders that fund single loans up to $30 million. Medina estates routinely require $5M-$15M financing. Qualification paths include full documentation, asset depletion, bank statement, and portfolio options with interest-only terms available for up to 10 years.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What mortgage options exist for tech founders in Hunts Point with irregular income?',
      answer: 'Tech founders with non-traditional income qualify through bank statement programs (12-24 months of deposits), asset depletion loans (liquid assets divided over the loan term create qualifying income), or pledged-asset mortgages. Wholesale brokers compare 50+ non-QM lenders to find the program that qualifies the highest loan amount at the lowest rate.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do DSCR loans work for Eastside investment properties?',
      answer: 'DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio) loans qualify based on rental income divided by the mortgage payment. A DSCR of 1.0 or higher means rent covers the payment. Eastside investors use DSCR loans for luxury rental properties, ADUs, and short-term rentals without providing personal tax returns or W-2s. Wholesale access means comparing 40+ DSCR lenders.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What down payment do I need for an ultra-luxury home in Clyde Hill?',
      answer: 'Down payment requirements vary by loan size and program. Institutional jumbo loans on Clyde Hill properties typically require 20-25% down for loans up to $3M, 25-30% for $3M-$5M, and 30-35% for loans above $5M. Bank statement and foreign national programs require 25-40% down depending on credit profile and loan amount.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do wholesale brokers offer foreign national mortgages for Eastside WA properties?',
      answer: 'Yes. Foreign national programs serve international tech workers, H-1B visa holders, and overseas investors purchasing in Medina, Hunts Point, Clyde Hill, Yarrow Point, and Beaux Arts Village. Wholesale brokers access 30+ foreign national lenders with down payments from 25-40%, no U.S. credit history required, and ITIN-acceptable programs.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is asset depletion lending and who qualifies in Medina and Hunts Point?',
      answer: 'Asset depletion divides your liquid assets (stocks, bonds, retirement accounts) by the loan term (typically 360 months) to create qualifying monthly income. A borrower with $10M in liquid assets generates $27,778/month in qualifying income. This program serves retired tech executives, early retirees, and high-net-worth individuals in Medina and Hunts Point who have substantial wealth but limited traditional income.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do interest-only mortgages work for Yarrow Point waterfront homes?',
      answer: 'Interest-only mortgages require payment of only the interest portion for the first 5-10 years, reducing monthly payments by 20-30%. On a $4M Yarrow Point waterfront loan at 6.5%, the interest-only payment is approximately $21,667/month versus $25,264 with principal. Wholesale lenders offer 10-year interest-only terms on jumbo loans, ideal for cash flow optimization.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What are current jumbo mortgage rates for ultra-luxury Eastside properties in 2026?',
      answer: 'Wholesale jumbo rates for ultra-luxury Eastside properties range from 5.875% to 7.25% in February 2026, depending on loan amount, down payment, credit score, and documentation type. Full-doc institutional jumbo loans price lowest. Bank statement and DSCR programs carry 0.5-1.5% premiums. Wholesale rates consistently beat retail by 0.25-0.75% on equivalent products.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I finance a Beaux Arts Village home with an LLC or trust?',
      answer: 'Yes. Many ultra-luxury buyers hold property in LLCs or revocable trusts for asset protection and estate planning. Wholesale brokers access lenders that close directly in entity names without requiring personal guarantees on certain programs. Vesting in a trust after closing is available with virtually all lenders.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does closing take on a $5M+ wholesale jumbo loan?',
      answer: 'Institutional jumbo loans above $5M typically close in 30-45 days with complete documentation. Bank statement programs take 25-35 days. Asset depletion and foreign national programs may require 35-50 days due to additional verification. Wholesale brokers coordinate directly with lender underwriting teams to prevent delays common in retail channels.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What credit score do I need for an ultra-luxury wholesale mortgage?',
      answer: 'Institutional jumbo programs require 700+ FICO for the best rates, with most lenders accepting 680+ with compensating factors (larger down payment, significant reserves). Bank statement programs start at 660+ for loans up to $2M and 700+ above $3M. Foreign national programs have separate credit evaluation standards that consider international credit history.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Why choose a wholesale broker over private banking for ultra-luxury Eastside financing?',
      answer: 'Private banks offer relationship-based pricing but require moving $1M+ in assets to their institution. Wholesale brokers access equivalent rates from 200+ lenders without asset custody requirements. Brokers also provide program diversity: if one lender declines, the file moves to another lender within days. Private banking relationships lock you into a single institution.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What reserves are required for a $7M mortgage on a Hunts Point lakefront estate?',
      answer: 'Reserve requirements scale with loan size. For a $7M mortgage, most institutional jumbo lenders require 12-18 months of PITIA reserves ($150,000-$300,000+ in liquid assets post-closing). Some wholesale lenders accept retirement accounts at 60-70% value toward reserves. Borrowers with $10M+ in liquid assets typically exceed reserve requirements automatically.',

        <p>
          Medina is home to some of the wealthiest individuals in the United States, including current and former tech CEOs whose estates range from $5 million to $100 million+. Financing in Medina demands lender familiarity with ultra-high-net-worth borrower profiles: concentrated stock positions worth hundreds of millions, complex trust structures, and income that arrives through K-1 distributions, capital gains, and deferred compensation rather than W-2 paychecks.
        </p>

        <p>
          Wholesale broker access solves Medina&apos;s core financing challenge: matching the right lender to each borrower&apos;s unique financial profile. A tech founder with $50M in pre-IPO stock but minimal W-2 income uses a bank statement program from one lender, while a retired Microsoft VP with $20M in brokerage accounts uses asset depletion from another. Retail banks force both borrowers into the same underwriting box. Wholesale brokers place each borrower with the lender whose guidelines produce the lowest rate for their specific situation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Medina properties frequently involve additional complexity: lakefront parcels with dock permits, guest houses requiring separate appraisals, and renovations of historic homes where as-completed valuations justify higher loan amounts. I work with appraisers who specialize in Medina&apos;s $5M-$30M+ property valuations and lenders who understand that a 6,500-square-foot lakefront estate on Evergreen Point Road requires different comparable analysis than a suburban home in Bellevue.

        <p>
          Hunts Point is the most exclusive residential community in Washington State. With approximately 450 residents across fewer than 200 homes, every property sits on Lake Washington waterfront or within steps of the shore. The gated, private road community has no commercial properties, no through traffic, and no public access&mdash;creating an appraisal environment where comparable sales data is extremely limited.
        </p>

        <p>
          Financing Hunts Point requires lenders who accept limited comparable sales, understand waterfront premium valuations, and fund loans above $10 million on a single-family residence. Retail banks cap jumbo lending at $3-5 million and require extensive committee approvals for exceptions. Wholesale institutional jumbo lenders fund up to $30 million with streamlined underwriting specifically designed for ultra-high-net-worth borrowers. These lenders evaluate the complete financial picture: liquid assets, investment portfolio strength, and income trajectory rather than applying rigid DTI formulas.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hunts Point transactions frequently involve pledged-asset mortgages where borrowers pledge investment portfolios as collateral instead of liquidating positions. This structure preserves investment gains, avoids capital gains tax events, and provides rates comparable to full-documentation jumbo loans. Through wholesale channels, I access five institutional lenders offering pledged-asset programs with loan amounts up to $20 million.

        <p>
          Clyde Hill occupies prime hilltop terrain between Bellevue and Medina, offering panoramic views of Lake Washington, the Seattle skyline, and the Olympic Mountains. The community attracts corporate executives, senior tech managers, and medical professionals who want ultra-luxury living within minutes of Bellevue&apos;s downtown core and the 520 bridge to Seattle. Clyde Hill&apos;s Bellevue School District assignment adds significant value for families.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Clyde Hill financing landscape centers on two patterns: established owners refinancing or extracting equity from properties purchased 5-15 years ago at 40-60% of current values, and new buyers competing for the 30-50 homes that list annually. New buyers face intense competition and benefit from wholesale broker pre-approval letters that demonstrate genuine financing capacity. I provide pre-approval letters within 24 hours backed by actual lender commitments, giving Clyde Hill buyers a competitive edge over retail pre-qualifications.
        </p>

        <p>
          Tear-down/rebuild transactions represent a growing segment of Clyde Hill financing. Buyers acquire aging 1960s-1980s homes on premium lots, demolish the existing structure, and construct custom estates valued at 2-3x the acquisition price. Wholesale brokers structure these transactions using construction-to-permanent loans from institutional lenders, bridging the gap between lot value ($1.5M-$3M) and completed home value ($4M-$8M) in a single close.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yarrow Point extends into Lake Washington as a small peninsula directly adjacent to the SR-520 floating bridge, providing Eastside residents with arguably the fastest commute to downtown Seattle of any ultra-luxury community. With approximately 1,100 residents and a mix of lakefront estates and elevated view properties, Yarrow Point attracts buyers who value both waterfront lifestyle and urban connectivity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Portfolio lending strategies dominate Yarrow Point financing. Many buyers already own multiple properties across the Eastside or nationwide, and their existing mortgage obligations affect qualification ratios. Wholesale brokers solve this through DSCR loans on investment properties (qualifying based on rental income rather than personal DTI) and portfolio lenders who evaluate total net worth rather than traditional debt-to-income calculations. I structure financing packages where the primary Yarrow Point purchase uses an institutional jumbo while investment properties convert to DSCR loans, optimizing the borrower&apos;s overall qualification profile.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yarrow Point&apos;s waterfront properties with private docks command substantial premiums. Dock permits on Lake Washington are limited and transferable with the property, adding $500,000-$1,500,000 to property values. Wholesale lenders experienced with waterfront appraisals ensure dock value is captured in the property valuation, maximizing the loan amount available to buyers. Retail banks frequently undervalue dock permits because their appraisal panels lack waterfront specialization.

The Yarrow Point purchase closed with a $3.675M institutional jumbo at 6.25%. Net rate savings across all four loans: 0.375% average.</p>

        <p>
          Beaux Arts Village is Washington&apos;s smallest incorporated municipality&mdash;approximately 300 residents across fewer than 120 homes on the southeastern shore of Lake Washington. Founded in 1908 as an artists&apos; colony, the community retains its creative character while attracting affluent professionals, tech workers seeking a quieter alternative to Bellevue, and retired executives who value the intimate village atmosphere over the more formal settings of Medina or Hunts Point.
        </p>

        <p>
          Financing Beaux Arts Village properties presents a unique challenge: extremely limited comparable sales. With fewer than 5-8 homes selling annually, appraisers must draw comparisons from adjacent communities (Enatai, Bellevue, Mercer Island) while accounting for Beaux Arts&apos; premium for community character, lakefront access, and exclusivity. Wholesale brokers work with appraisal management companies that assign local specialists rather than generalists, ensuring property values reflect the true market position.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bank statement and asset depletion programs serve Beaux Arts Village&apos;s creative professional community particularly well. Artists, authors, consultants, and creative directors with variable income streams qualify through deposit history rather than tax returns that may understate earning capacity. Downsizing executives moving from $5M+ Medina or Hunts Point homes into $2M Beaux Arts properties often have substantial liquid assets from the sale proceeds, making asset depletion the ideal qualification path.

          <p className="mb-0">A successful independent film director purchased a $2.2M Beaux Arts Village lakefront cottage. With project-based income averaging $400K/year but tax returns showing $180K after production company deductions, retail banks offered only $850K. Through wholesale channels, I secured a $1.65M bank statement loan using 24 months of personal deposits showing $380K average annual income. Rate: 6.875%, 30-year fixed. The director preserved investment accounts and purchased without selling any production equipment.</p>

        {/* Why Wholesale Section */}
        <h2 id="why-wholesale" className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Why Ultra-Luxury Eastside Buyers Choose Wholesale Mortgage Brokers</h2>

        <p>
          Ultra-luxury financing is fundamentally different from standard mortgage origination. A $400,000 conforming loan involves checking boxes against Fannie Mae guidelines. A $7 million Hunts Point lakefront estate requires creative structuring, specialized lender relationships, and deep knowledge of non-QM products. Here is why the wholesale channel outperforms retail banking for ultra-luxury Eastside transactions:
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">1. Rate Competition Across 200+ Lenders</h3>
        <p>
          Wholesale brokers submit loan scenarios to multiple institutional jumbo lenders simultaneously. When lenders compete for ultra-luxury business, rates drop. On a $5M institutional jumbo, the spread between the highest and lowest wholesale rate is typically 0.50-0.875%. On a 30-year term, that spread equals $75,000-$131,250 in total interest savings. Retail banks offer one rate from one institution with no competitive pressure.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">2. Program Diversity for Complex Borrower Profiles</h3>
        <p>
          Ultra-luxury Eastside buyers rarely fit traditional underwriting profiles. Tech founders have stock-heavy compensation. Retired executives have asset wealth without employment income. International investors have overseas income documentation. Each scenario requires a different loan product, and wholesale access provides every product from multiple lenders. If Lender A declines, Lender B may approve the same file with minor adjustments.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">3. Appraisal Expertise for $3M-$20M+ Properties</h3>
        <p>
          Ultra-luxury appraisals require specialists who understand waterfront premiums, view adjustments, estate-level amenities, and limited comparable sales markets. Wholesale brokers control appraiser selection through preferred panel relationships, ensuring the assigned appraiser has documented experience valuing $3M+ properties in the specific community. Retail banks assign appraisals through random rotation systems that frequently pair ultra-luxury properties with appraisers who lack relevant experience.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">4. Speed and Discretion for Private Transactions</h3>
        <p>
          Ultra-luxury Eastside buyers value privacy. Wholesale mortgage brokers work directly with lender underwriting teams, bypassing retail branch networks, loan officer committees, and multiple approval layers. A $10M loan through wholesale moves through a dedicated high-net-worth underwriting desk with a single point of contact. Retail banks route the same loan through branch manager review, regional approval, and executive committee sign-off, adding 2-4 weeks and exposing the transaction to additional personnel.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">5. No Asset Custody Requirements</h3>
        <p>
          Private banks and wealth management divisions require borrowers to transfer $1M-$5M+ in assets to their institution in exchange for favorable mortgage pricing. Wholesale brokers deliver equivalent or better rates without requiring any asset movement. Your investments stay with your current wealth manager, your retirement accounts remain untouched, and your financial relationships remain intact.
