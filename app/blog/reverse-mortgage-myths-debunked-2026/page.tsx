            Reverse mortgages are surrounded by myths and misconceptions. The truth: <strong>HECM reverse mortgages are FHA-insured, federally regulated financial products</strong> with mandatory counseling, non-recourse protection, and extensive consumer safeguards. Separating myth from reality helps seniors make informed decisions about whether a reverse mortgage fits their situation.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Myth #1: "Reverse Mortgages Are Scams"</h2>

        <div className="bg-red-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
          <p className="font-semibold text-red-800 mb-0">❌ THE MYTH</p>
          <p className="text-red-900 mb-0">Reverse mortgages are predatory scams designed to steal homes from seniors.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-green-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
          <p className="font-semibold text-green-800 mb-0">✅ THE TRUTH</p>
          <p className="text-green-900 mb-0">HECM reverse mortgages are legitimate, FHA-insured financial products with extensive federal regulation and consumer protections.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Why This Myth Exists</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Scammers have used reverse mortgage terminology in fraudulent schemes</li>
          <li>Early reverse mortgage products (pre-HECM) had fewer protections</li>
          <li>Misunderstanding of how the product works</li>
          <li>Negative media coverage of isolated bad actors</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Reality</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>FHA-insured:</strong> Government backing with strict requirements</li>
          <li><strong>Mandatory counseling:</strong> HUD-approved counseling required before application</li>
          <li><strong>Non-recourse protection:</strong> Can never owe more than home value</li>
          <li><strong>Extensive regulation:</strong> Consumer Financial Protection Bureau oversight</li>
          <li><strong>Licensed lenders:</strong> State and federal licensing requirements</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Myth #2: "The Bank Takes Your Home"</h2>

        <div className="bg-red-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
          <p className="font-semibold text-red-800 mb-0">❌ THE MYTH</p>
          <p className="text-red-900 mb-0">When you get a reverse mortgage, the bank owns your home.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-green-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
          <p className="font-semibold text-green-800 mb-0">✅ THE TRUTH</p>
          <p className="text-green-900 mb-0">You retain full ownership. The lender has a lien (same as any mortgage), but the title stays in your name.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>What Actually Happens</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Title remains in your name</li>
          <li>You make all decisions about the property</li>
          <li>You can sell at any time</li>
          <li>You can refinance at any time</li>
          <li>You can leave it to heirs</li>
          <li>The lender has a lien—exactly like a traditional mortgage</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Myth #3: "You Can Owe More Than the Home Is Worth"</h2>

        <div className="bg-red-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
          <p className="font-semibold text-red-800 mb-0">❌ THE MYTH</p>
          <p className="text-red-900 mb-0">If the loan balance grows larger than your home value, you or your heirs will be stuck with massive debt.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-green-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
          <p className="font-semibold text-green-800 mb-0">✅ THE TRUTH</p>
          <p className="text-green-900 mb-0">HECM is non-recourse: you or heirs can never owe more than the home's value. FHA insurance covers any shortfall.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Non-Recourse Protection Explained</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Maximum liability = home value at time of sale</li>
          <li>If loan balance exceeds home value, FHA insurance pays difference</li>
          <li>Heirs can walk away with zero obligation</li>
          <li>No deficiency judgments possible</li>
          <li>This protection is required by law for HECM loans</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Myth #4: "You'll Lose Your Home"</h2>

        <div className="bg-red-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
          <p className="font-semibold text-red-800 mb-0">❌ THE MYTH</p>
          <p className="text-red-900 mb-0">People with reverse mortgages end up losing their homes to foreclosure.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-green-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
          <p className="font-semibold text-green-800 mb-0">✅ THE TRUTH</p>
          <p className="text-green-900 mb-0">You can stay in your home for life as long as you meet basic obligations: pay property taxes, maintain insurance, and keep up the property.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>What Can Trigger Repayment</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You sell the home</li>
          <li>You move out for 12+ consecutive months</li>
          <li>You pass away (heirs then have options)</li>
          <li>You fail to pay property taxes or insurance</li>
          <li>You fail to maintain the property</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Protections in Place</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Financial assessment ensures you can afford taxes/insurance</li>
          <li>LESA (Life Expectancy Set-Aside) can be set up to pay these automatically</li>
          <li>Servicers must work with borrowers before foreclosure</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Myth #5: "Reverse Mortgages Are Only for Desperate People"</h2>

        <div className="bg-red-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
          <p className="font-semibold text-red-800 mb-0">❌ THE MYTH</p>
          <p className="text-red-900 mb-0">Only seniors in financial trouble get reverse mortgages.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-green-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
          <p className="font-semibold text-green-800 mb-0">✅ THE TRUTH</p>
          <p className="text-green-900 mb-0">Many financially comfortable seniors use reverse mortgages strategically as a retirement planning tool.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Strategic Uses</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Delay Social Security:</strong> Bridge income to maximize benefits at age 70</li>
          <li><strong>Protect investment portfolio:</strong> Avoid selling stocks in down market</li>
          <li><strong>Line of credit as safety net:</strong> Growing credit line for emergencies</li>
          <li><strong>Age in place:</strong> Fund home modifications for accessibility</li>
          <li><strong>Tax-efficient retirement income:</strong> Loan proceeds are not taxable</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Myth #6: "Your Heirs Get Nothing"</h2>

        <div className="bg-red-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
          <p className="font-semibold text-red-800 mb-0">❌ THE MYTH</p>
          <p className="text-red-900 mb-0">A reverse mortgage uses up all your equity, leaving nothing for your children.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-green-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
          <p className="font-semibold text-green-800 mb-0">✅ THE TRUTH</p>
          <p className="text-green-900 mb-0">Many reverse mortgage borrowers die with significant equity remaining. Heirs inherit any equity above the loan balance.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Factors Affecting Remaining Equity</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>How much was borrowed (lump sum vs. line of credit)</li>
          <li>How long the borrower lived in the home</li>
          <li>Home value appreciation over time</li>
          <li>Interest rate on the loan</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Heir Options</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Sell home and keep excess equity</li>
          <li>Refinance and keep the home</li>
          <li>Pay off loan and keep the home</li>
          <li>If underwater, walk away (non-recourse protection)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Myth #7: "You Need Good Credit"</h2>

        <div className="bg-red-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
          <p className="font-semibold text-red-800 mb-0">❌ THE MYTH</p>
          <p className="text-red-900 mb-0">You need excellent credit to qualify for a reverse mortgage.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-green-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
          <p className="font-semibold text-green-800 mb-0">✅ THE TRUTH</p>
          <p className="text-green-900 mb-0">There is no minimum credit score requirement for HECM reverse mortgages. Lenders review credit history as part of financial assessment, but scores don't determine eligibility.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>What Matters Instead</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Age (62+)</li>
          <li>Home equity</li>
          <li>Ability to pay property taxes and insurance</li>
          <li>Property condition</li>
          <li>Completion of HUD counseling</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Myth #8: "It's Too Expensive"</h2>

        <div className="bg-red-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
          <p className="font-semibold text-red-800 mb-0">❌ THE MYTH</p>
          <p className="text-red-900 mb-0">Reverse mortgage fees are outrageously high and make them a bad deal.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-green-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
          <p className="font-semibold text-green-800 mb-0">✅ THE TRUTH</p>
          <p className="text-green-900 mb-0">Costs are higher than traditional refinancing but are regulated by FHA with caps on origination fees. Most costs can be financed (no out-of-pocket). The value depends on how you use the product.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Actual Cost Structure</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Origination fee:</strong> Capped at $6,000 maximum</li>
          <li><strong>Mortgage Insurance Premium:</strong> 2% upfront + 0.5% annually</li>
          <li><strong>Closing costs:</strong> Similar to traditional refinance</li>
          <li><strong>Most costs:</strong> Can be financed into the loan</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cost-Benefit Consideration</h3>
        <p>
          Compare costs to alternatives: selling and moving, traditional refinance with required payments, or depleting other retirement savings. The "right" cost depends on your alternatives.
        </p>

        <h2>Myth #9: "Medicare/Social Security Will Be Affected"</h2>

        <div className="bg-red-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
          <p className="font-semibold text-red-800 mb-0">❌ THE MYTH</p>
          <p className="text-red-900 mb-0">Reverse mortgage funds will cause you to lose Medicare or Social Security.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-green-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
          <p className="font-semibold text-green-800 mb-0">✅ THE TRUTH</p>
          <p className="text-green-900 mb-0">Reverse mortgage proceeds do not affect Social Security or Medicare, as these are not means-tested programs. Medicaid (which is means-tested) may be affected.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Benefit Impact Summary</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Social Security:</strong> Not affected (not means-tested)</li>
          <li><strong>Medicare:</strong> Not affected (not means-tested)</li>
          <li><strong>Medicaid:</strong> May be affected (means-tested)—consult benefits specialist</li>
          <li><strong>SSI:</strong> May be affected (means-tested)—consult benefits specialist</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Myth #10: "You Can't Get Out Once You're In"</h2>

        <div className="bg-red-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
          <p className="font-semibold text-red-800 mb-0">❌ THE MYTH</p>
          <p className="text-red-900 mb-0">Once you have a reverse mortgage, you're locked in forever.</p>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-green-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
          <p className="font-semibold text-green-800 mb-0">✅ THE TRUTH</p>
          <p className="text-green-900 mb-0">You can pay off or refinance a reverse mortgage at any time with no prepayment penalty. You can also sell the home whenever you choose.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Exit Options</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sell the home:</strong> Pay off loan from proceeds</li>
          <li><strong>Refinance:</strong> To different reverse mortgage or traditional mortgage</li>
          <li><strong>Pay off:</strong> From other funds if you choose</li>
          <li><strong>No penalty:</strong> No prepayment penalties on HECM loans</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>Is a reverse mortgage a scam?</h3>
        <p>
          No. HECM reverse mortgages are FHA-insured, federally regulated financial products with significant consumer protections including mandatory HUD counseling, non-recourse protection, and disclosure requirements.
        </p>

        <h3>Does the bank own my home with a reverse mortgage?</h3>
        <p>
          No. You retain full ownership. The lender has a lien (same as any mortgage), but the title remains in your name.
        </p>

        <h3>Will I owe more than my home is worth?</h3>
        <p>
          The loan balance can exceed home value, but you'll never owe more than the home is worth. Non-recourse protection ensures this.
        </p>

        <h3>Are reverse mortgages only for people in financial trouble?</h3>
        <p>
          No. Many financially comfortable seniors use them strategically for retirement planning, Social Security optimization, or as a financial safety net.
        </p>

        <h2>Learn More</h2>
        <p>
          The required HUD counseling session is an excellent opportunity to have all your questions answered by an independent counselor before making any decisions.
