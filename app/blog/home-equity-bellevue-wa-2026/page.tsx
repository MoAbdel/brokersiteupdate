            According to Mo Abdel, NMLS #1426884 at Lumin Lending (NMLS #2716106, DRE #02291443): &quot;Bellevue homeowners sit on significant home equity&mdash;often $500,000 to $2 million or more in established neighborhoods.&quot; The Bellevue housing market recorded a median sale price of $1.62 million in January 2026, up 5.8% year-over-year according to Redfin data, with West Bellevue estates exceeding $3 million. Whether you&apos;re planning renovations, consolidating debt, funding education, or making investments, accessing that equity through a HELOC, home equity loan, or cash-out refinance requires comparing your options carefully. As a wholesale mortgage broker licensed in Washington, I help Bellevue homeowners find the best equity solution with access to 200+ lenders.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Why Bellevue Homeowners Are Tapping Equity</h2>
          <p>
            Bellevue&apos;s transformation into a major tech hub has created substantial wealth for long-term homeowners. Properties purchased 10-20 years ago have often appreciated 3-5x in value, creating equity positions that can fund major goals.

              <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">What home equity options are available for Bellevue homeowners?</h3>
              <p>Bellevue homeowners can access equity through three main options: HELOC (home equity line of credit), HELOAN (fixed-rate home equity loan), or cash-out refinance. The best choice depends on your goals, current mortgage rate, and how you plan to use the funds.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
              <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">How much equity can I access in my Bellevue home?</h3>
              <p>Most lenders allow access to 80-85% of your home value minus existing mortgage balance. With Bellevue median values around $1.6M, homeowners with significant equity can often access $400,000-$800,000 or more depending on their situation.</p>

              <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Should I get a HELOC or cash-out refinance in Bellevue?</h3>
              <p>If your current mortgage rate is low, a HELOC keeps your first mortgage intact while adding a credit line. If rates have dropped or you want to consolidate, cash-out refinance replaces your mortgage with a larger one and gives you the difference in cash.</p>

              <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Can I use home equity to build an ADU in Bellevue?</h3>
              <p>Yes. Many Bellevue homeowners use HELOCs or cash-out refinances to fund accessory dwelling units (ADUs). This can provide rental income or housing for family members while potentially increasing property value.</p>
