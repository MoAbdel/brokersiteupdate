        <p>
          Coto de Caza&apos;s real estate market remains robust with limited inventory and strong demand from families seeking the community&apos;s top-rated schools, resort-style amenities, and secure environment. The gap between the conforming loan limit ($1,149,825) and median prices ($2.1M) means nearly every purchase requires jumbo financing expertise.
        </p>

        <h3>The Coto de Caza Borrower Profile</h3>
        <p>
          A significant portion of Coto de Caza homebuyers are self-employed—business owners, entrepreneurs, consultants, and executives with equity compensation. These borrowers often show lower taxable income due to legitimate business deductions, making traditional bank underwriting challenging. This is where wholesale broker access to bank statement programs becomes invaluable.
