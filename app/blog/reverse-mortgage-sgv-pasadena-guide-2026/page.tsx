          <p className="text-gray-800 mb-0">
            San Gabriel Valley homeowners age 62 and older are sitting on an estimated <strong>$48 billion in collective home equity</strong> across Pasadena, San Marino, Arcadia, La Ca&ntilde;ada Flintridge, South Pasadena, Sierra Madre, Glendale, Montrose, and La Crescenta. The 2026 FHA HECM lending limit stands at <strong>$1,149,825</strong>, yet the median home value in San Marino alone exceeds <strong>$3 million</strong>, with La Ca&ntilde;ada Flintridge at <strong>$2.2 million</strong> and Arcadia at <strong>$1.8 million</strong>. For most SGV seniors, proprietary (jumbo) reverse mortgage programs represent the path to accessing full equity. As a wholesale mortgage broker with access to over 200 lenders, I help San Gabriel Valley seniors compare HECM and proprietary reverse mortgage options from multiple providers, ensuring the most competitive terms for every property type and price point in this region.

        <h2>San Gabriel Valley Reverse Mortgage Overview: 9-City Comparison [2026]</h2>
        <p>
          The San Gabriel Valley encompasses two distinct market tiers for reverse mortgage planning. The upper-tier cities feature legacy estates with median values well above $1.5 million, while the mid-tier cities offer strong equity positions in the $1 million to $1.4 million range. Both tiers provide seniors with substantial equity access opportunities through reverse mortgage products tailored to their property values.

        {/* Market Overview */}
        <h2>San Gabriel Valley Housing Market &amp; Senior Demographics [2026]</h2>
        <p>
          The San Gabriel Valley is one of Southern California's most established and valuable residential corridors. Stretching from the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains through the flatlands east of downtown Los Angeles, this region combines old-money legacy estates, world-class research institutions, premier healthcare facilities, and a dynamic multicultural economy that supports some of the highest home values in Los Angeles County outside of the Westside.
        </p>

        <h3>Caltech, JPL &amp; the Research Economy</h3>
        <p>
          The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) form the intellectual backbone of the western San Gabriel Valley. Thousands of scientists, engineers, and researchers have spent 30- to 40-year careers at these institutions and now own homes in Pasadena, La Ca&ntilde;ada Flintridge, and South Pasadena. Many of these retirees purchased their homes in the 1980s and 1990s when prices were a fraction of current values, meaning they hold extraordinary equity positions.
        </p>
        <p>
          A retired Caltech professor who purchased a Pasadena Craftsman in 1990 for $350,000 now sits on a property worth over $1.5 million. A JPL senior engineer who bought in La Ca&ntilde;ada Flintridge in 1995 for $450,000 holds a home now valued above $2.2 million. These seniors are ideal reverse mortgage candidates because they have massive equity, fixed retirement incomes, and a strong desire to age in place near the institutions and communities that defined their careers.
        </p>

        <h3>Healthcare &amp; Biotech Corridor</h3>
        <p>
          The San Gabriel Valley hosts major medical centers including Huntington Hospital in Pasadena, City of Hope in Duarte, and Methodist Hospital in Arcadia. The healthcare ecosystem employs thousands of physicians, nurses, administrators, and researchers, many of whom have lived in the area for decades. Glendale's Adventist Health complex and the numerous medical offices along Foothill Boulevard create an additional concentration of healthcare professionals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Retired healthcare workers in Glendale and Pasadena represent a growing segment of reverse mortgage applicants. After decades of high-earning medical careers, they own homes with significant equity and seek ways to supplement pension and retirement savings without monthly loan payments.
        </p>

        <h3>Historic Homes &amp; Legacy Estates</h3>
        <p>
          The San Gabriel Valley contains some of Southern California's most historically significant residential architecture. Pasadena's Craftsman bungalows, Greene and Greene masterworks, and Spanish Colonial Revival estates in San Marino and South Pasadena define the architectural heritage of the region. Many of these homes have been in the same families for two or three generations.
        </p>
        <p>
          San Marino's tree-lined streets feature estate properties that regularly sell above $3 million, with the most prestigious addresses near the Huntington Library and Lacy Park commanding prices exceeding $5 million. La Ca&ntilde;ada Flintridge offers large-lot estate properties in the foothills above the Descanso Gardens, where privacy and views combine with excellent La Ca&ntilde;ada Unified School District boundaries. These properties generate exceptional reverse mortgage proceeds when accessed through proprietary programs.
        </p>

        <h3>Chinese-American &amp; Asian-American Buyer Market</h3>
        <p>
          Arcadia and San Marino have attracted substantial Chinese-American and broader Asian-American investment and homeownership over the past three decades. Many families purchased homes in the early 2000s and 2010s, and the parents or grandparents who bought these properties are now reaching reverse-mortgage-eligible age. The multigenerational household structure common in these communities creates unique opportunities for reverse mortgage planning, where senior homeowners can access equity while younger family members contribute to property tax and insurance obligations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The demand for bilingual reverse mortgage services in Mandarin and Cantonese continues to grow in the eastern SGV. Working with a broker who understands these cultural dynamics and can connect clients with HUD-approved counselors offering multilingual services is critical for this market segment.
        </p>

            These four cities form the upper tier of San Gabriel Valley real estate, where median home values range from <strong>$1.8 million in Arcadia and South Pasadena to $3 million in San Marino</strong>. Legacy wealth, generational homeownership, and proximity to top-rated school districts sustain the premium valuations that make proprietary reverse mortgages the dominant product for seniors in this hub.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>San Marino ($3M median):</strong> The Huntington Library neighborhood anchors the highest values. Estate lots of 15,000+ square feet with mature landscaping define the market. Proprietary reverse mortgage programs accommodating values to $4M+ are essential for San Marino seniors seeking to unlock maximum equity.</li>
            <li><strong>La Ca&ntilde;ada Flintridge ($2.2M median):</strong> JPL and Caltech retirees dominate the senior homeowner demographic. Foothill estates with panoramic views command premium appraisals. The Flintridge proper area and the streets near Descanso Gardens feature the most valuable properties for reverse mortgage planning.</li>
            <li><strong>South Pasadena ($1.8M median):</strong> Charming Craftsman-era homes in a walkable downtown setting attract long-term residents who never want to leave. The Mission District and Marengo Avenue corridor feature homes ideally suited for HECM or proprietary reverse mortgages.</li>
            <li><strong>Arcadia ($1.8M median):</strong> Upper Rancho and the Arcadia Highlands offer homes that frequently exceed $2 million. The strong Chinese-American community presence means multigenerational planning is often a factor in reverse mortgage decisions. Seniors living in renovated mid-century homes hold equity positions that favor proprietary programs.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-0">
            Senior homeowners in these cities frequently hold <strong>$800,000 to $2,000,000+</strong> in accessible equity through proprietary reverse mortgage programs.

          <p>
            These five cities represent the broader Pasadena metro area, where median values range from <strong>$1 million in La Crescenta to $1.4 million in Sierra Madre</strong>. This hub provides strong opportunities for both FHA HECM and proprietary reverse mortgages, depending on specific property values and borrower goals.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Pasadena ($1.2M median):</strong> The Rose Parade district, South Lake Avenue, and the historic neighborhoods near Caltech offer a mix of modest bungalows and grand estates. Pasadena's diverse housing stock means some properties fit neatly within the HECM limit while others require proprietary programs. Madison Heights and Linda Vista-Annandale are prime reverse mortgage markets.</li>
            <li><strong>Sierra Madre ($1.4M median):</strong> This small foothill community offers canyon properties and charming downtown homes. Long-term residents who bought decades ago hold exceptional equity positions. The village atmosphere and proximity to hiking trails make aging in place particularly appealing for Sierra Madre seniors.</li>
            <li><strong>Glendale ($1.2M median):</strong> Rossmoyne, Verdugo Woodlands, and Sparr Heights feature homes with strong equity potential. The large Armenian-American community in Glendale includes many homeowners who purchased in the 1990s and 2000s and are now approaching reverse mortgage eligibility. Healthcare employment from Adventist Health anchors the local senior economy.</li>
            <li><strong>Montrose ($1.1M median):</strong> The Honolulu Avenue corridor and surrounding residential streets offer mid-century and early-century homes with solid equity. Montrose seniors benefit from HECM programs that align well with the neighborhood's median values.</li>
            <li><strong>La Crescenta ($1M median):</strong> Foothills properties in Briggs Terrace, Dunsmore, and Glenwood provide seniors with equity positions that fit the HECM program well.

          </ul>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-0">
            Senior homeowners in these cities can access <strong>$400,000 to $840,000</strong> through HECM or proprietary programs, depending on property value and borrower age.

        {/* Reverse Mortgage Process in SGV */}
        <h2>The Reverse Mortgage Process for San Gabriel Valley Homeowners</h2>
        <p>
          The reverse mortgage application process in the San Gabriel Valley follows a structured timeline designed to protect seniors through mandatory counseling and thorough underwriting. Here is the step-by-step process from initial consultation to closing.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Free consultation with Mo Abdel (Day 1):</strong> We review your San Gabriel Valley property, discuss your financial goals, and determine whether HECM or proprietary reverse mortgage products best suit your situation. I provide a preliminary equity estimate based on your home's location and value.</li>
          <li><strong>HUD-approved counseling (Days 2-14):</strong> Federal law requires all HECM applicants to complete a counseling session with a HUD-approved agency. This session covers reverse mortgage mechanics, alternatives, and obligations. Several agencies serve the SGV area, and sessions can be completed by phone. This is a mandatory step that protects you as the borrower.</li>
          <li><strong>Application submission (Day 15):</strong> After counseling, we submit your application to the lender or lenders best suited to your property and needs. I compare programs from multiple wholesale lenders to find the strongest terms.</li>
          <li><strong>Professional appraisal (Days 16-25):</strong> A licensed appraiser inspects and values your home. In the SGV, luxury and historic properties in San Marino, La Ca&ntilde;ada Flintridge, or South Pasadena may require specialized appraisers familiar with estate-level valuations. The appraisal determines the maximum loan amount.</li>
          <li><strong>Underwriting review (Days 25-35):</strong> The lender evaluates the appraisal, counseling certificate, financial assessment, and all documentation. This includes verifying property taxes, insurance, and HOA obligations are current.</li>
          <li><strong>Closing (Days 35-45):</strong> You sign closing documents, and after a 3-day right of rescission period, funds are disbursed according to your chosen payout plan. A title company in the San Gabriel Valley handles the closing.</li>
        </ol>

        {/* HECM vs Proprietary Deep Dive */}
        <h2>HECM vs. Proprietary Reverse Mortgages: Which Is Right for Your SGV Home?</h2>
        <p>
          Choosing between a federally insured HECM and a proprietary reverse mortgage is the most important decision San Gabriel Valley seniors face. The answer depends primarily on your home's value relative to the $1,149,825 HECM limit.
        </p>

        <h3>When HECM Makes Sense in the SGV</h3>
        <p>
          The standard FHA HECM works well for homes valued at or near the $1,149,825 limit. In the San Gabriel Valley, this typically applies to properties in La Crescenta, Montrose, and select neighborhoods in Glendale and Pasadena where home values cluster in the $900,000 to $1,200,000 range. HECM advantages include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>FHA insurance protection:</strong> If the lender goes out of business, HUD ensures you continue receiving funds</li>
          <li><strong>Guaranteed non-recourse:</strong> You or your heirs never owe more than the home's value</li>
          <li><strong>Line of credit growth:</strong> Unused HECM credit line grows over time regardless of home value changes</li>
          <li><strong>No credit score minimum:</strong> Financial assessment focuses on obligations, not FICO scores</li>
          <li><strong>Standardized fees:</strong> FHA caps origination fees and regulates closing costs</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>When Proprietary Makes Sense in the SGV</h3>
        <p>
          For the majority of San Gabriel Valley properties, including nearly all homes in San Marino, La Ca&ntilde;ada Flintridge, South Pasadena, Arcadia, and Sierra Madre, proprietary programs access far more equity than HECM. Key advantages:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Higher lending limits:</strong> Access equity on homes valued up to $4 million or more</li>
          <li><strong>No FHA mortgage insurance premium:</strong> Saves 2% upfront and 0.5% annually</li>
          <li><strong>Potentially faster processing:</strong> Some proprietary lenders close in 21-30 days</li>
          <li><strong>Condo flexibility:</strong> Not limited to FHA-approved condo projects</li>
          <li><strong>Age options:</strong> Some programs accept borrowers as young as 60</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Real-World SGV Examples</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Scenario 1 - San Marino Estate:</strong> A 74-year-old retired physician in San Marino owns a $3.2 million estate near the Huntington Library, free and clear. Under HECM, proceeds are capped based on the $1,149,825 limit. With a proprietary reverse mortgage, the borrower accesses equity based on the full $3.2 million appraised value, potentially receiving over $1.5 million in available funds.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Scenario 2 - Pasadena Craftsman:</strong> A 68-year-old retired Caltech professor owns a $1.1 million Craftsman in the Madison Heights neighborhood with $200,000 remaining on a traditional mortgage. The HECM program works well here: proceeds pay off the existing mortgage and provide a line of credit for supplemental retirement income. Estimated net available: $350,000-$400,000.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Scenario 3 - Arcadia Multigenerational Home:</strong> A 72-year-old grandmother owns a $2 million home in Upper Rancho where her adult children and grandchildren also reside. A proprietary reverse mortgage allows her to access equity without monthly payments, and the multigenerational household helps manage property tax, insurance, and maintenance obligations. Estimated equity access: $800,000-$1,000,000.

        <h2>Why San Gabriel Valley Seniors Trust Mo Abdel for Reverse Mortgages</h2>
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-xl border border-gray-200 mb-6">
          <p>
            As a licensed mortgage broker (NMLS #1426884) with Lumin Lending, Inc. (NMLS #2716106, DRE #02291443), I bring wholesale market access and deep local knowledge to every reverse mortgage consultation in the San Gabriel Valley. Here is what sets my approach apart:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>200+ lender access:</strong> I compare HECM and proprietary reverse mortgage programs from dozens of wholesale lenders simultaneously. San Marino homeowners with $3 million+ properties deserve multiple proprietary options, not a single bank's product.</li>
            <li><strong>SGV market knowledge:</strong> I understand the nuances of San Gabriel Valley real estate, from San Marino estate valuations to Pasadena Craftsman appraisals. Proper property valuation directly affects your reverse mortgage proceeds.</li>
            <li><strong>Transparent fee comparison:</strong> I present side-by-side fee comparisons from multiple lenders, ensuring you understand every cost before committing. No surprises at closing.</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural sensitivity:</strong> The San Gabriel Valley's diverse communities require a broker who respects cultural preferences around homeownership, family planning, and financial privacy. I work with clients from all backgrounds and can connect you with HUD-approved counselors offering multilingual services.</li>
            <li><strong>Licensed in California and Washington:</strong> For SGV families with properties in multiple states, I can coordinate reverse mortgage strategies across state lines.</li>

        {/* Protecting Your SGV Home */}
        <h2>Protecting Your San Gabriel Valley Home: Obligations &amp; Safeguards</h2>
        <p>
          A reverse mortgage provides powerful financial flexibility, but San Gabriel Valley homeowners must understand the ongoing obligations that keep the loan in good standing. Failure to meet these obligations can trigger a default.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Property taxes:</strong> Los Angeles County property taxes must remain current. For a $2 million Arcadia home, annual property taxes may exceed $20,000. Ensure you have a plan to cover this expense from reverse mortgage proceeds, savings, or family support.</li>
          <li><strong>Homeowner&apos;s insurance:</strong> Maintain adequate coverage for your property's full replacement value. SGV estate properties require higher coverage limits than standard policies.</li>
          <li><strong>Home maintenance:</strong> Keep the property in reasonable condition. Historic homes in Pasadena and South Pasadena may require periodic maintenance investments to preserve their character and value.</li>
          <li><strong>Primary residence:</strong> The home must remain your primary residence. Vacating the home for more than 12 consecutive months triggers repayment.</li>
          <li><strong>HOA dues:</strong> If applicable, keep condominium or homeowner association fees current.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Life Event Planning for SGV Seniors</h3>
        <p>
          San Gabriel Valley seniors should also plan for life events that affect reverse mortgage status:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Spouse protections:</strong> If both spouses are on the reverse mortgage, the surviving spouse continues receiving benefits. Non-borrowing spouses under 62 should discuss eligible non-borrowing spouse protections before proceeding.</li>
          <li><strong>Moving to assisted living:</strong> If you need to move to a care facility, the reverse mortgage becomes due after 12 months of absence. Planning ahead allows you to sell the home and retain equity above the loan balance.</li>
          <li><strong>Inheritance planning:</strong> HECM non-recourse protection means your heirs never owe more than the appraised value. Most SGV properties appreciate faster than the reverse mortgage balance grows, preserving equity for heirs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Addressing Common San Gabriel Valley Reverse Mortgage Concerns</h2>
        <p>
          SGV homeowners frequently raise the following concerns during initial consultations. Understanding the facts helps seniors make informed decisions about whether a reverse mortgage aligns with their retirement strategy.
        </p>

        <h3>&ldquo;I want to leave my home to my children.&rdquo;</h3>
        <p>
          A reverse mortgage does not prevent inheritance. Your heirs inherit the home and choose whether to sell (keeping equity above the loan balance), refinance the reverse mortgage, or pay it off. In the San Gabriel Valley, where properties appreciate consistently, homes typically retain substantial equity above the reverse mortgage balance. A $2 million La Ca&ntilde;ada Flintridge home with a $600,000 reverse mortgage balance still leaves $1.4 million in equity for heirs.
        </p>

        <h3>&ldquo;The fees seem high.&rdquo;</h3>
        <p>
          Reverse mortgage closing costs include origination fees, appraisal, title insurance, and (for HECM) mortgage insurance premiums. These costs are real, but they can be financed into the loan, requiring no out-of-pocket expense. When compared to the alternative of selling a $2.5 million San Marino home (6% real estate commission = $150,000), the reverse mortgage closing costs are a fraction of the cost of selling.
        </p>

        <h3>&ldquo;Interest rates are a concern.&rdquo;</h3>
        <p>
          Reverse mortgage interest accrues on the outstanding balance, not the total home value. Choosing a line of credit means you only accrue interest on funds actually drawn. Strategic use of the credit line, drawing only what you need when you need it, minimizes total interest costs over the life of the loan.
        </p>

        <h3>&ldquo;I have an existing mortgage.&rdquo;</h3>
        <p>
          Reverse mortgage proceeds first pay off any existing mortgage balance. If you have a $300,000 remaining balance on a $1.8 million South Pasadena home, the reverse mortgage eliminates that monthly payment and provides access to additional equity above the payoff amount. Many SGV seniors find the elimination of monthly mortgage payments alone justifies the reverse mortgage.

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions: Reverse Mortgages in the San Gabriel Valley</h2>

        <div className="space-y-6 my-8">
          <div className="border-b border-gray-200 pb-4">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Can I get a reverse mortgage on my San Gabriel Valley home in 2026?</h3>
            <p>Yes, if you are 62 or older, live in the home as your primary residence, and have sufficient equity. San Gabriel Valley homes in cities like San Marino, Arcadia, and La Ca&ntilde;ada Flintridge frequently exceed the FHA HECM limit of $1,149,825, making proprietary reverse mortgages the preferred option for accessing maximum equity.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="border-b border-gray-200 pb-4">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">What is the FHA HECM limit for San Gabriel Valley in 2026?</h3>
            <p>The 2026 FHA HECM lending limit is $1,149,825 for all of Los Angeles County, including every San Gabriel Valley city. Homes valued above this limit benefit from proprietary (jumbo) reverse mortgage programs that accommodate values up to $4 million or higher.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="border-b border-gray-200 pb-4">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">How much can a San Marino homeowner get from a reverse mortgage?</h3>
            <p>San Marino median home values exceed $3 million, so most homeowners benefit from a proprietary reverse mortgage. Depending on the borrower&apos;s age and current interest rates, seniors can typically access 40-60% of their home&apos;s appraised value. A 72-year-old with a free-and-clear $3 million home could potentially access over $1.5 million.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="border-b border-gray-200 pb-4">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Is HUD counseling required for San Gabriel Valley reverse mortgages?</h3>
            <p>Yes, HUD-approved counseling is mandatory for all FHA HECM reverse mortgages. The session can be completed by phone or in person and typically takes 60-90 minutes. Some proprietary reverse mortgage products also require counseling. Several HUD-approved counseling agencies serve the San Gabriel Valley area.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="border-b border-gray-200 pb-4">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">What happens to my Pasadena home after I pass away with a reverse mortgage?</h3>
            <p>Your heirs inherit the home and have options: sell the home and keep equity above the loan balance, refinance the reverse mortgage into a traditional loan, or pay off the balance and keep the property. HECM loans are non-recourse, meaning heirs never owe more than the home&apos;s appraised value.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="border-b border-gray-200 pb-4">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Can I get a reverse mortgage on a La Ca&ntilde;ada Flintridge estate property?</h3>
            <p>Yes, estate properties in La Ca&ntilde;ada Flintridge qualify for reverse mortgages as long as the home is your primary residence. Large estate homes with values above $2 million are well-suited for proprietary reverse mortgage programs. Single-family homes, approved condos, and properties up to 4 units are eligible.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="border-b border-gray-200 pb-4">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">What is the difference between HECM and proprietary reverse mortgages in the SGV?</h3>
            <p>HECM is the FHA-insured program capped at $1,149,825 with government protections including non-recourse guarantees and line of credit growth. Proprietary reverse mortgages are private-lender products that accommodate home values above the HECM limit, often up to $4 million or more. In the San Gabriel Valley, where many homes exceed $1.5 million, proprietary programs unlock significantly more equity.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="border-b border-gray-200 pb-4">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">How long does a reverse mortgage take in the San Gabriel Valley?</h3>
            <p>The typical timeline is 30-45 days from application to closing. HUD counseling takes 1-2 weeks to schedule and complete. High-value properties in areas like San Marino or La Ca&ntilde;ada Flintridge may require specialized appraisals that add a few days to the standard timeline.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="border-b border-gray-200 pb-4">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Can I use a reverse mortgage to buy a new home in Arcadia?</h3>
            <p>Yes, the HECM for Purchase program allows seniors 62 and older to buy a new primary residence using reverse mortgage financing. You combine a down payment (typically 40-60% of the purchase price) with reverse mortgage proceeds, and you never make monthly mortgage payments. This is popular with Arcadia buyers downsizing from larger family homes.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="border-b border-gray-200 pb-4">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Do I lose ownership of my home with a reverse mortgage?</h3>
            <p>No. You retain full ownership and title to your home. A reverse mortgage is simply a loan secured by your property. You must continue paying property taxes, homeowner&apos;s insurance, and maintain the home. You can live in the home for as long as you choose.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="border-b border-gray-200 pb-4">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Are reverse mortgage proceeds taxable for San Gabriel Valley seniors?</h3>
            <p>Reverse mortgage proceeds are loan advances, not income, so they are not subject to federal income tax. This makes reverse mortgages an efficient way for SGV seniors to supplement retirement income without increasing their tax burden. Consult a tax professional for your specific situation.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="border-b border-gray-200 pb-4">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">What fees are involved in a San Gabriel Valley reverse mortgage?</h3>
            <p>HECM fees include an origination fee (capped by FHA), mortgage insurance premium, appraisal fee, title insurance, and closing costs. Proprietary programs have different fee structures. Working with a wholesale broker helps compare fees across lenders to find the most competitive terms for your SGV property.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="border-b border-gray-200 pb-4">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Can retired Caltech or JPL employees in Pasadena get a reverse mortgage?</h3>
            <p>Retired Caltech and JPL employees who are 62 or older and own their Pasadena home are excellent candidates for reverse mortgages. Many have lived in their homes for decades and hold significant equity. The financial assessment considers property tax and insurance obligations, not income level, making this product well-suited to retirees.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="border-b border-gray-200 pb-4">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Why should I work with a wholesale broker for my SGV reverse mortgage?</h3>
            <p>A wholesale broker accesses multiple HECM and proprietary reverse mortgage lenders simultaneously, comparing programs, rates, and fees across the wholesale market. This provides more options and competitive pricing compared to working with a single bank or lender. For high-value SGV properties, having access to multiple proprietary programs is essential for maximizing your equity access.</p>

          <h2 className="mt-0 text-xl font-bold text-green-900">Expert Summary: Reverse Mortgages in the San Gabriel Valley [2026]</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-800">
            The San Gabriel Valley represents one of Southern California&apos;s strongest markets for reverse mortgage equity access. With nine cities ranging from $1 million median values in La Crescenta to $3 million in San Marino, SGV seniors hold an extraordinary volume of untapped home equity. The region&apos;s concentration of retired Caltech, JPL, and healthcare professionals creates a demographic perfectly suited to reverse mortgage products: high equity, fixed retirement incomes, and deep community ties that make aging in place the preferred choice.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-800">
            For homes valued above $1,149,825, proprietary reverse mortgage programs unlock equity far beyond what the standard HECM provides. For homes at or near the HECM limit, the FHA-insured product delivers government-backed protections including line of credit growth and guaranteed non-recourse terms. In either case, working with a wholesale broker who compares programs from multiple lenders ensures SGV seniors access the most competitive terms available in 2026.
