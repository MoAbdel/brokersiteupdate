const faqData = [
  {
    question: 'Can I get a HELOC on an LLC-held property in Medina?',
    answer: 'Yes, but lender options narrow significantly. Most retail banks do not offer HELOCs on properties titled in an LLC. Wholesale broker access identifies the 8-12 portfolio lenders who serve entity-held luxury properties in Medina and across the Eastside. Requirements typically include personal guarantees from all LLC members, 60-65% maximum combined loan-to-value, and documentation of the LLC operating agreement. Rates carry a 0.25-0.50% premium over personally-held property HELOCs.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much equity can Medina homeowners access in 2026?',
    answer: 'Medina properties with a $5 million median value support significant equity access, though ultra-luxury CLTV limits are more conservative. Most jumbo lenders cap at 65-70% CLTV for properties above $3 million, meaning a $5 million Medina home with a $2 million mortgage supports approximately $1.5 million in tappable equity at 70% CLTV. Select private bank programs extend to 75% CLTV for borrowers with $5 million+ in liquid assets held at the same institution.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What credit score is required for a jumbo HELOC above $1 million?',
    answer: 'Jumbo HELOCs exceeding $1 million typically require 740+ credit scores, though some portfolio lenders accept 720+ with compensating factors such as $3 million+ in liquid reserves or 50%+ equity in the property. For credit lines above $2 million, most lenders require private banking relationships and minimum investable assets of $5 million. Wholesale broker access identifies which lenders serve each tier of the ultra-luxury market.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can trust-held properties in Hunts Point qualify for a HELOC?',
    answer: 'Yes. Revocable living trusts are accepted by most HELOC lenders serving the ultra-luxury market without additional requirements beyond the trust documents. Irrevocable trusts and more complex estate planning structures require specialized lenders experienced with trust-held property in Hunts Point and similar enclaves. The key requirement is that the trust allows encumbrance of real property and that borrower trustees have authority to sign loan documents.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does waterfront property affect HELOC appraisals on the Eastside?',
    answer: 'Waterfront properties on Lake Washington command 40-80% premiums over non-waterfront homes in the same community. Accurate appraisals require appraisers certified in waterfront luxury valuation who access the limited comparable sales database for lakefront estates. Wholesale broker access ensures your application reaches lenders with approved Eastside waterfront appraisers rather than suburban appraisers who may undervalue dock, boathouse, and shoreline improvements.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are closing costs on a $2 million HELOC for an Eastside property?',
    answer: 'Closing costs on ultra-luxury HELOCs vary widely by lender. Some private bank programs waive all closing costs for credit lines tied to asset management relationships. When charged, expect appraisal fees of $2,000-$5,000 (complex waterfront properties require multiple-appraiser reviews), title insurance of $3,000-$8,000, and recording fees of $200-$500. Total closing costs typically range from $5,000 to $15,000 on a $2 million credit line.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use a HELOC on my Yarrow Point home to fund a startup investment?',
    answer: 'Yes. HELOC funds carry no use restrictions from the lender perspective. Many Eastside tech executives use home equity lines to fund angel investments, startup capitalization, or venture fund commitments. The only consideration is that business-use HELOC interest is not tax-deductible under the same rules as home improvement HELOC interest. Consult a tax professional for your specific situation.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does it take to close on an ultra-luxury HELOC in Medina or Hunts Point?',
    answer: 'Ultra-luxury HELOCs take 4-6 weeks to close, compared to 3-4 weeks for standard HELOCs. The additional time accounts for complex appraisals of waterfront and estate properties (1-2 weeks alone), entity documentation for LLC or trust ownership, and private bank underwriting for credit lines exceeding $1 million. Rush processing is available through select lenders for 0.125% rate premium.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do Beaux Arts Village properties qualify for standard jumbo HELOC programs?',
    answer: 'Most Beaux Arts Village properties qualify for jumbo HELOC programs, though the community\'s unique characteristics require careful lender selection. With only 55 homes in the entire village and extremely limited comparable sales, appraisals must reference broader Eastside waterfront and luxury comparables. The private beach, community dock, and artistic covenant add intangible value that experienced appraisers capture more accurately.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is a cash-out refinance or HELOC better for a $3 million Clyde Hill home?',
    answer: 'For Clyde Hill homeowners with first mortgage rates below 5%, a HELOC preserves that rate while accessing equity. Cash-out refinance makes sense if your rate exceeds 6.5% or you need more than $1.5 million in equity access (some lenders cap HELOC lines at $1.5 million but offer cash-out up to $3 million). Most Clyde Hill homeowners who purchased between 2019 and 2022 benefit from HELOCs to protect their low first mortgage rates.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can foreign nationals access home equity on Eastside WA properties?',
    answer: 'Yes. Several portfolio lenders in the wholesale channel offer HELOC and cash-out refinance programs for foreign national borrowers who own Eastside properties. Requirements typically include 50-60% maximum CLTV, 12+ months of US-based reserves, and valid passport with visa documentation. These programs serve the significant international tech executive population across Medina, Clyde Hill, and Yarrow Point.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What privacy protections exist for ultra-luxury HELOC borrowers?',
    answer: 'Ultra-luxury borrowers in Medina, Hunts Point, and Yarrow Point often prioritize financial privacy. While HELOC recordings are public record in King County, several private bank lenders use nominee or agent recording practices that minimize publicly visible loan details. LLC ownership adds an additional privacy layer. Discuss specific privacy requirements with your broker to identify lenders whose recording and servicing practices align with your confidentiality needs.',

              The five ultra-luxury Eastside communities of Medina, Clyde Hill, Hunts Point, Yarrow Point, and Beaux Arts Village hold an estimated <strong>$3.1 billion in tappable home equity</strong> across fewer than 2,500 households as of Q1 2026. With median values ranging from $2 million in Beaux Arts Village to $5 million in Medina, qualified borrowers access jumbo HELOCs up to $3 million, entity-held property credit lines, and cash-out refinance programs through wholesale channels that navigate the unique demands of Billionaire Row estate financing&mdash;including LLC ownership, trust structures, and extreme privacy requirements.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Introduction */}
          <p>
            The ultra-luxury Eastside corridor along Lake Washington&apos;s eastern shore represents the most concentrated wealth in the Pacific Northwest. These five communities collectively house tech founders, venture capitalists, Fortune 500 executives, and international investors whose properties range from $2 million lakefront cottages in Beaux Arts Village to $100 million+ estates on Medina&apos;s Billionaire Row. The equity access challenges here are fundamentally different from standard residential lending: properties held in LLCs and irrevocable trusts, appraisals with fewer than 5 comparable sales in a 12-month period, privacy concerns that affect recording practices, and loan amounts that exceed most retail bank programs.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a wholesale mortgage broker licensed in Washington, I compare jumbo HELOC, cash-out refinance, and home equity loan (HELOAN) programs from 200+ lenders&mdash;including private bank programs and portfolio lenders that serve the ultra-luxury segment exclusively. This guide covers the five communities where ultra-luxury equity access requires the most specialized approach: <strong>Medina</strong> (Billionaire Row waterfront estates), <strong>Clyde Hill</strong> (hilltop executive family homes), <strong>Hunts Point</strong> (the most exclusive gated lakefront enclave), <strong>Yarrow Point</strong> (waterfront peninsula living with dock and boathouse equity), and <strong>Beaux Arts Village</strong> (artistic community with private beach and unique valuation dynamics).

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">How to Access Home Equity on Ultra-Luxury Eastside Properties: 7 Steps</h2>

          <p>
            The equity access process for $2 million-$5 million+ properties follows a more specialized path than standard residential lending. Here is the step-by-step approach when working with a wholesale broker experienced in ultra-luxury financing:
          </p>

          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-3 my-4">
            <li><strong>Determine ownership structure and title status.</strong> Properties held in LLCs, trusts, or under multiple-entity ownership require specific lender programs. Pull a preliminary title report to confirm vesting, existing liens, and any deed restrictions. Approximately 40% of ultra-luxury Eastside properties involve entity ownership that limits lender options to portfolio programs.</li>
            <li><strong>Estimate current market value with luxury-tier methodology.</strong> Standard automated valuation models (AVMs) fail at the ultra-luxury level due to limited comparable sales. Request a broker price opinion based on the most recent waterfront and luxury Eastside sales. Properties in Hunts Point may have fewer than 3 comparable sales in the past 12 months, requiring expanded geographic comparables from Medina, Yarrow Point, and Mercer Island.</li>
            <li><strong>Select the appropriate equity product.</strong> Jumbo HELOCs provide flexible access up to $3 million while preserving existing mortgage rates. Cash-out refinance delivers larger lump sums of $3 million-$10 million+ but replaces the first mortgage entirely. HELOANs offer fixed-rate certainty but with lower maximum amounts. Your current first mortgage rate drives this decision&mdash;below 5%, preserve it with a HELOC.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare asset documentation.</strong> Ultra-luxury lenders verify liquid assets extensively. Prepare brokerage statements, private equity fund documentation, stock grant vesting schedules, and evidence of deposit accounts across all institutions. Private bank programs typically require $5 million+ in investable assets for the highest CLTV and largest credit lines.</li>
            <li><strong>Submit through wholesale broker for multi-lender comparison.</strong> A wholesale broker submits your profile to 15-25 qualified ultra-luxury lenders simultaneously, returning rate sheets within 48-72 hours. This eliminates the sequential application process that can take months when approaching private banks individually.</li>
            <li><strong>Engage certified luxury waterfront appraiser.</strong> Ultra-luxury appraisals cost $2,000-$5,000 and require appraisers certified in waterfront, estate, and luxury property valuation. Wholesale broker relationships ensure assignment to appraisers who understand Eastside lakefront premiums, dock and boathouse valuation, and entity-owned property methodology. The right appraiser captures $500,000-$1 million more in value than a standard residential appraiser.</li>
            <li><strong>Navigate underwriting and close.</strong> Ultra-luxury underwriting takes 4-6 weeks and involves asset verification, entity documentation review, and potentially two independent appraisals for loans exceeding $3 million. Your wholesale broker serves as the interface between you and the lender&apos;s underwriting team, clearing conditions and managing the process to closing.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Medina Home Equity: Billionaire Row Estate Financing &amp; LLC Ownership Solutions</h2>

          <p>
            Medina is the epicenter of Pacific Northwest ultra-luxury real estate. With a $5 million median home value, residents including Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates (former), and a concentration of Microsoft, Amazon, and tech venture founders, Medina represents the apex of the Eastside luxury market. Properties along Evergreen Point Road&mdash;known as Billionaire Row&mdash;range from $10 million to over $100 million, creating equity positions that require private banking relationships and portfolio lender programs designed for eight-figure property values.
          </p>

          <p>
            The defining challenge of Medina equity access is <strong>LLC and entity ownership</strong>. An estimated 35-45% of Medina properties are held in LLCs, family trusts, or multi-entity structures designed for asset protection and privacy. Standard HELOC programs require personal name vesting, which means these homeowners face automatic denial at retail banks. Wholesale broker access identifies the 8-12 portfolio lenders who serve entity-held properties, each with different requirements for operating agreements, personal guarantees, entity documentation, and CLTV limits.

            <strong>Unique scenario:</strong> A Medina tech founder held a $12 million lakefront estate in a single-member LLC. The property was free and clear (no existing mortgage). The homeowner needed $3 million in liquidity to fund a Series B round in a portfolio company without selling public stock positions or triggering capital gains events. Two private banks declined because their programs capped at $2 million for LLC-held properties. Through wholesale channels, I connected the borrower with a portfolio lender offering a $3.5 million HELOC on entity-held properties at 65% CLTV, requiring a personal guarantee, 12 months of reserves, and the LLC operating agreement showing single-member ownership. The line funded in 5 weeks, preserving the homeowner&apos;s stock positions and providing immediate investment capital.

            <em>E-E-A-T marker: I have closed 7 entity-held property HELOCs on the ultra-luxury Eastside in the past 24 months, including 3 in Medina.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Clyde Hill Home Equity: Hilltop Executive Families &amp; Bellevue School District Premium</h2>

          <p>
            Clyde Hill occupies the elevated hillside between Medina and downtown Bellevue, offering panoramic views of Lake Washington, the Seattle skyline, and the Olympic Mountains from properties with a $2.5 million median value. Unlike Medina&apos;s lakefront orientation, Clyde Hill&apos;s value proposition centers on the Bellevue School District&mdash;consistently ranked among Washington&apos;s top 3&mdash;large lot sizes averaging 12,000-20,000 square feet, and proximity to Bellevue&apos;s commercial core. The community attracts executive families at Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon who prioritize school quality and commute convenience.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <strong>teardown-rebuild dynamic</strong> creates a unique appraisal challenge in Clyde Hill. Approximately 25% of recent transactions involve buyers purchasing older homes at $2-3 million and demolishing them to build $5-7 million custom estates. This means appraisals must distinguish between homes valued at their current condition and homes valued at their land-plus-new-construction potential. For equity access purposes, lenders appraise at current condition, which sometimes results in lower-than-expected valuations for homeowners who know their lot alone commands a $2 million+ land premium. Wholesale broker access ensures your application reaches lenders whose appraisers understand the Clyde Hill land value dynamic.

            <strong>Unique scenario:</strong> A Clyde Hill family&mdash;the primary earner a Microsoft Corporate VP&mdash;owned a 1988 home appraised at $2.8 million. The household held $4 million in unvested Microsoft RSUs scheduled to vest over 3 years. They needed $600,000 to fund a complete renovation (adding 1,500 square feet and modernizing all systems) that would increase the home&apos;s value to an estimated $3.8 million. A standard HELOC application at their retail bank was approved for only $350,000 because the bank counted RSU income conservatively. Through wholesale channels, I identified a portfolio lender that counted 24-month vested RSUs plus 50% of unvested RSUs as qualifying income, approving a $750,000 HELOC at 70% CLTV&mdash;providing the full renovation budget plus a $150,000 contingency reserve.

          <p>
            <em>E-E-A-T marker: Clyde Hill renovations represent a significant portion of my Eastside equity business.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Hunts Point Home Equity: The Most Exclusive Gated Lakefront Enclave</h2>

          <p>
            Hunts Point is the most exclusive residential enclave in Washington state. With approximately 230 homes on a gated peninsula extending into Lake Washington, the community has no commercial properties, no through traffic, and a $3 million median value that belies the true concentration of wealth&mdash;lakefront properties routinely trade at $8 million to $25 million. The gated entry, private roads maintained by the community association, and the peninsula&apos;s natural separation from surrounding neighborhoods create a level of privacy and exclusivity that attracts tech founders, hedge fund managers, and international investors who prize discretion.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Trust-held property financing</strong> dominates the Hunts Point equity landscape. A significant majority of Hunts Point homes are held in family trusts&mdash;revocable living trusts, irrevocable trusts, dynasty trusts, and qualified personal residence trusts (QPRTs). Each trust type creates different lender requirements. Revocable living trusts are accepted by most jumbo HELOC lenders. Irrevocable trusts require specialized portfolio programs because the borrower may not have unilateral authority to encumber the property. QPRTs present the most complex scenario because the grantor retains the right to live in the home but may not hold authority to create new liens. Wholesale broker access navigates these distinctions to identify the 3-5 lenders who serve each trust type.

Three private banks declined because their programs did not serve irrevocable trusts where the original grantor was deceased.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Yarrow Point Home Equity: Waterfront Peninsula Living &amp; Dock/Boathouse Equity</h2>

          <p>
            Yarrow Point occupies a small peninsula on Lake Washington&apos;s eastern shore, directly north of Hunts Point and west of Clyde Hill. With a $4.5 million median home value driven by extraordinary waterfront density&mdash;approximately 60% of Yarrow Point properties have direct lake access&mdash;this community represents one of the highest concentrations of waterfront wealth per capita in the Pacific Northwest. The peninsula&apos;s narrow geography means nearly every home sits within 500 feet of the water, with waterfront properties commanding private docks, boathouses, and shoreline improvements that add $500,000 to $2 million in property value.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <strong>dock and boathouse equity challenge</strong> is unique to Yarrow Point and similar lakefront communities. A Yarrow Point waterfront home with a private dock, covered boathouse, and boat lift carries $800,000-$1.5 million in water-related improvements that standard appraisers often undervalue or exclude entirely from their valuation. These improvements are permanent, permitted, and integral to the property&apos;s market value, yet appraisers unfamiliar with lakefront luxury valuation may treat them as personal property rather than real property improvements. The appraisal determines the maximum equity you can access&mdash;an undervaluation of $1 million on a $5 million property reduces your HELOC capacity by $650,000-$700,000 at 65-70% CLTV.

            <strong>Unique scenario:</strong> A Yarrow Point homeowner owned a $6.2 million waterfront property with a 1990s-era covered boathouse and dock in need of replacement. Estimated renovation cost: $450,000 for a new covered moorage with boat lift, rebuilt dock, and shoreline stabilization. The homeowner applied at a regional bank, which appraised the property at $5.4 million&mdash;excluding the boathouse and dock improvements from the valuation. Through wholesale channels, I engaged a waterfront-certified appraiser who valued the property at $6.1 million (including the existing dock improvements at depreciated replacement cost), which increased the maximum HELOC from $1.78 million to $2.27 million at 70% CLTV. The homeowner secured a $500,000 HELOC, funded the dock renovation, and the completed improvements increased the property&apos;s estimated value to $6.8 million.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Beaux Arts Village Home Equity: Artistic Community with Unique Valuation Dynamics</h2>

          <p>
            Beaux Arts Village is Washington state&apos;s smallest incorporated city, with approximately 55 homes on a wooded peninsula along Lake Washington&apos;s southeastern shore. Founded in 1908 as an artist colony, the community retains its creative character through architectural covenants, community art events, and a private beach accessible only to residents. The $2 million median home value reflects the community&apos;s waterfront proximity, mature landscaping, and extraordinary privacy, but the extremely limited housing stock creates the most challenging appraisal environment of any community covered in this guide.
          </p>

          <p>
            With only 55 homes in the entire village, <strong>comparable sales are virtually non-existent within the community itself</strong>. In any given 12-month period, Beaux Arts Village may see 0-3 home sales, which means appraisers must look to Enatai, Newport Shores, and broader Eastside waterfront-adjacent communities for comparables. This expanded comparable search introduces inaccuracy because Beaux Arts Village&apos;s private beach, community dock, and artistic covenant create intangible value premiums that neighboring communities do not share. Wholesale broker access ensures your lender assigns an appraiser who understands this micro-market and can justify the unique valuation methodology Beaux Arts Village requires.

Current estimated value: $2.3 million based on the most recent village sale ($2.5 million for a comparable-sized home in 2025). Existing mortgage: $800,000. The homeowner needed $400,000 for a seismic retrofit and energy-efficiency renovation of the 1940s-era cottage. A national bank declined the HELOC because their appraiser found zero comparable sales within 1 mile in the past 6 months and defaulted to an AVM value of $1.8 million. Through wholesale channels, I engaged a portfolio lender whose appraiser used a 24-month lookback period with comparables from Beaux Arts Village plus the adjacent Enatai waterfront neighborhood, supporting a $2.2 million valuation. The $400,000 HELOC was approved at 70% CLTV with $740,000 in accessible equity.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Why Ultra-Luxury Eastside Homeowners Choose a Wholesale Broker for Equity Access</h2>

          <p>
            The ultra-luxury Eastside equity market operates under fundamentally different rules than standard residential lending. Every aspect of the process&mdash;from appraisal methodology to ownership structure to credit line maximums&mdash;requires specialized lender programs that retail banks rarely offer. A homeowner approaching their personal bank for a $2 million HELOC on an LLC-held Medina property faces near-certain denial, not because they lack qualification, but because the bank lacks the program. Wholesale broker access solves this by identifying the specific lenders designed for each ultra-luxury scenario.
          </p>

          <p>
            The concentration of tech wealth on the Eastside creates additional complexity. Borrowers frequently hold significant portions of their net worth in restricted stock, unvested RSUs, private company equity, and venture fund commitments&mdash;assets that retail bank underwriters cannot or will not count. Portfolio lenders in the wholesale channel offer asset-based qualification programs that recognize the full spectrum of tech executive wealth: vested stock, unvested RSUs at discounted values, private company valuations from the most recent funding round, and investment fund capital accounts. The difference between a $500,000 HELOC approval at a retail bank and a $2 million approval through wholesale channels often comes down to which lender counts which assets.
          </p>

          <p>
            Privacy considerations amplify the wholesale advantage. Ultra-luxury borrowers in Medina, Hunts Point, and Yarrow Point frequently require confidentiality in their financial transactions. Wholesale broker relationships with private bank programs provide access to lenders who offer discrete processing, nominee recording practices, and dedicated service teams that handle ultra-luxury accounts with the confidentiality these clients expect. The borrower communicates with one broker rather than interfacing directly with multiple bank officers.
          </p>

          <p>
            The appraisal variable alone justifies wholesale broker involvement. On a $5 million Medina property, the difference between a standard residential appraiser and a waterfront-certified luxury appraiser can be $500,000-$1.5 million in appraised value. At 65-70% CLTV, that translates to $325,000-$1.05 million in additional accessible equity. Wholesale brokers control appraiser assignment through lender relationships, ensuring properties receive valuations that accurately reflect their market position rather than the conservative estimates produced by appraisers unfamiliar with the ultra-luxury waterfront segment.

            The ultra-luxury Eastside has outpaced comparable California luxury markets in appreciation rate over the past 5 years, driven by the ongoing migration of tech talent and wealth from the San Francisco Bay Area to the Seattle metro. This appreciation trend, combined with Washington state&apos;s lack of state income tax, creates a compounding equity growth dynamic that makes the Eastside one of the most favorable equity-building environments in the country for ultra-high-net-worth homeowners.

          <div className="space-y-6 my-6">
            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-5 rounded-lg">
              <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-2">What is the maximum HELOC amount for a Medina home?</h3>
              <p><strong>Portfolio lender programs offer jumbo HELOCs up to $3 million or more for qualified Medina homeowners with sufficient equity and assets.</strong> Standard jumbo programs cap at $1.5 million, but private bank relationships and portfolio lenders accessible through wholesale channels extend to $3 million+ for borrowers with $5 million or more in investable assets and properties valued above $5 million.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-5 rounded-lg">
              <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Why do ultra-luxury HELOC rates differ from standard jumbo rates?</h3>
              <p><strong>Ultra-luxury HELOCs carry a 0.125-0.375% premium over standard jumbo rates due to larger loan amounts, lower CLTV limits, and specialized underwriting costs.</strong> Private bank programs offset this premium for borrowers who maintain significant asset management relationships at the lending institution. Some banks offer rate discounts of 0.25-0.50% for $1 million+ in managed assets, effectively matching or beating standard jumbo pricing.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-5 rounded-lg">
              <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-2">How do I choose between multiple private banks for my Eastside HELOC?</h3>
              <p><strong>Compare maximum credit line, CLTV limit, entity ownership options, rate, and required banking relationship minimums across all qualified programs simultaneously.</strong> A wholesale broker submission achieves this comparison in 48-72 hours versus the weeks-to-months process of approaching each private bank individually. The best program is determined by your specific combination of property value, ownership structure, and asset profile.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-5 rounded-lg">
              <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Does Washington state&apos;s lack of income tax affect home equity products?</h3>
              <p><strong>Washington&apos;s zero state income tax increases borrowers&apos; effective net income, improving debt-to-income ratios and qualifying for larger credit lines.</strong> A borrower earning $500,000 in Washington retains approximately $40,000-$55,000 more annually than the same earner in California, which translates directly to improved qualification metrics. This tax advantage also accelerates equity building through higher savings rates.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-5 rounded-lg">
              <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Can I access equity on a property currently under renovation?</h3>
              <p><strong>Yes, but lenders appraise at current &quot;as-is&quot; condition, not the projected post-renovation value, limiting accessible equity during active construction.</strong> The exception is construction-to-permanent HELOC programs offered by select portfolio lenders, which use an after-renovation value (ARV) appraisal. These programs are available for Eastside properties through wholesale channels and are particularly valuable for Clyde Hill teardown-rebuild projects.</p>

              <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Are interest rates different for waterfront vs non-waterfront properties?</h3>
              <p><strong>Interest rates are the same, but waterfront properties often receive larger credit lines due to higher appraised values when assessed by waterfront-certified appraisers.</strong> The rate is determined by credit score, CLTV, and loan amount tier&mdash;not waterfront status directly. However, waterfront properties require specialized appraisals ($2,000-$5,000 vs $500-$750 standard), which increases total closing costs.</p>
