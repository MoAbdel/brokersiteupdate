            According to Mo Abdel, NMLS #1426884 at Lumin Lending (NMLS #2716106, DRE #02291443): &quot;A HELOC keeps your first mortgage intact and adds a second lien with flexible access, while a cash-out refinance replaces your mortgage entirely with a new, larger loan.&quot; With the Federal Reserve holding rates steady through early 2026 and roughly 60% of U.S. homeowners locked into first mortgages below 4%, choosing the right equity access strategy has never been more important. In 2026, choose a HELOC if you have a favorable first mortgage rate you want to keep; choose cash-out if you can improve your rate or need a large lump sum with simpler payments. As a wholesale broker with access to 200+ lenders, I compare both products side-by-side to find the best fit for your situation.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">When to Choose a HELOC Over Cash-Out Refinance</h2>
          <p>
            A HELOC makes more sense than a cash-out refinance when:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>You have a low first mortgage rate:</strong> If your current rate is below current market rates, a HELOC preserves your favorable terms</li>
            <li><strong>You need flexible access:</strong> Ongoing expenses or uncertain amounts benefit from revolving credit</li>
            <li><strong>You want lower upfront costs:</strong> HELOC closing costs are significantly lower</li>
            <li><strong>You need funds quickly:</strong> HELOCs typically close faster than refinances</li>
            <li><strong>You may pay off balance quickly:</strong> Interest-only periods and no closing costs make short-term borrowing cost-effective</li>
          </ul>
          <p>

            <li><strong>You can improve your rate:</strong> If current rates are lower than your existing mortgage, you benefit twice</li>
            <li><strong>You need a large lump sum:</strong> Major one-time expenses like debt consolidation or large renovations</li>
            <li><strong>You want payment simplicity:</strong> One fixed payment is easier to budget than two variable payments</li>
            <li><strong>You&apos;re concerned about rising rates:</strong> Lock in a fixed rate instead of variable HELOC exposure</li>
            <li><strong>You need maximum equity access:</strong> Cash-out refinances sometimes allow higher LTV than HELOCs</li>

              <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">Should I get a HELOC or cash-out refinance in 2026?</h3>
              <p>Choose a HELOC if you have a favorable first mortgage rate you want to keep and need flexible access to funds. Choose a cash-out refinance if you can improve your current rate or need a large lump sum with simplified payments.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
              <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">What is the difference between a HELOC and cash-out refinance?</h3>
              <p>A HELOC adds a second lien while keeping your first mortgage intact, offering revolving credit with variable rates. A cash-out refinance replaces your entire mortgage with a new, larger loan, giving you a lump sum with typically fixed rates.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
              <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">Which has lower closing costs: HELOC or cash-out refinance?</h3>
              <p>HELOCs typically have lower closing costs, often ranging from $0-$500. Cash-out refinances have closing costs of 2-5% of the loan amount since they involve a full mortgage transaction.</p>
            </div>

            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
              <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">Can I use both a HELOC and cash-out refinance?</h3>
              <p>You can have a HELOC after a cash-out refinance, but they serve different purposes. Many homeowners do a cash-out refinance first, then add a HELOC later for additional flexibility. Combined equity access is limited by your total available equity.</p>

            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
              <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">Is HELOC interest tax deductible like a cash-out refinance?</h3>
              <p>Interest on both HELOCs and cash-out refinances may be tax-deductible if the funds are used for home improvements. Interest used for other purposes is generally not deductible. Consult a tax advisor for your specific situation.</p>
