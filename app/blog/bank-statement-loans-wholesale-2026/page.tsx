            Bank statement loans allow self-employed borrowers to qualify using <strong>12-24 months of bank deposits instead of tax returns</strong>, and wholesale brokers offer the widest selection with access to <strong>50+ bank statement lenders</strong>. Each lender uses different calculation methods, credit requirements, and guidelines—giving wholesale brokers the ability to find solutions when banks say no.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>What Are Bank Statement Loans?</h2>
        <p>
          Bank statement loans provide alternative income documentation for borrowers who can't qualify using traditional methods:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Alternative documentation:</strong> 12-24 months of bank statements replace tax returns</li>
          <li><strong>Deposit-based income:</strong> Lenders calculate income from your deposit history</li>
          <li><strong>Perfect for self-employed:</strong> Business owners, freelancers, consultants, entrepreneurs</li>
          <li><strong>Non-QM product:</strong> Not sold to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Self-Employed Borrowers Struggle with Banks</h2>
        <p>
          Traditional bank underwriting creates challenges for self-employed borrowers:
        </p>

        <h3>The Tax Return Problem</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Business deductions reduce taxable income:</strong> Smart tax planning looks bad on mortgage applications</li>
          <li><strong>Banks require 2 years of returns:</strong> New businesses may not qualify</li>
          <li><strong>Income averaging:</strong> One bad year can disqualify you for 2+ years</li>
          <li><strong>Complex business structures:</strong> K-1s, S-corps, and partnerships complicate documentation</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Single-Lender Limitation</h3>
        <p>
          When you apply at a bank, you get one set of guidelines. If their calculation method doesn't work for your situation, you're denied—and must start over elsewhere. Banks don't shop for better fits because they only have one product to offer.
        </p>

        <h2>The Wholesale Broker Bank Statement Advantage</h2>

        <h3>Access to 50+ Bank Statement Lenders</h3>
        <p>
          Wholesale brokers have relationships with dozens of lenders offering bank statement programs:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Varying calculation methods:</strong> Some favor gross deposits, others net deposits</li>
          <li><strong>Different credit tiers:</strong> Programs for 620-680-720+ scores</li>
          <li><strong>Flexible statement periods:</strong> 12 months vs 24 months options</li>
          <li><strong>Personal vs business accounts:</strong> Different treatment by lender</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>If One Lender Denies, 49+ More to Try</h3>
        <p>
          The wholesale advantage is most powerful after a denial:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Denied for credit score? Another lender has lower minimums</li>
          <li>Denied for deposit calculation? Another lender uses different formula</li>
          <li>Denied for reserves? Another lender requires less</li>
          <li>Same broker, same file, different lender, different outcome</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Deposit Calculation Works</h2>
        <p>
          Different lenders calculate income differently—and wholesale brokers know which method favors each borrower:
        </p>

        <h3>Personal Account Calculations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Gross deposits:</strong> Total deposits divided by statement months</li>
          <li><strong>Expense ratio:</strong> Some lenders apply 0-15% expense factor</li>
          <li><strong>Transfer exclusions:</strong> Exclude transfers between own accounts</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Business Account Calculations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Expense factor:</strong> Lenders apply 25-50% expense ratio</li>
          <li><strong>Industry variations:</strong> Some lenders adjust by business type</li>
          <li><strong>Profit margin approach:</strong> Some use documented profit margins</li>
        </ul>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-xl my-6">
          <p className="text-blue-800 font-semibold mb-2">Wholesale Broker Insight:</p>
          <p className="text-blue-700 mb-0">
            A borrower with $50,000 monthly business deposits could qualify for very different loan amounts depending on the lender's expense factor (50% vs 75% = $25,000 vs $37,500 monthly income). Wholesale brokers shop for the calculation method that maximizes your qualifying income.
