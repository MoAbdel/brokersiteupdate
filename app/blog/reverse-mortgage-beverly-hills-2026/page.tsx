        <h3>Reverse Mortgage vs Selling</h3>
        <p>
          Many Beverly Hills seniors don't want to leave their homes and community. A reverse mortgage allows you to:

        <ul>
          <li>Stay in your beloved home</li>
          <li>Maintain your lifestyle and community connections</li>
          <li>Access equity without the stress of moving</li>
          <li>Avoid capital gains taxes on home sale</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions: Reverse Mortgages in Beverly Hills</h2>

        <h3>Can I get a reverse mortgage on my Beverly Hills home?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, if you're 62 or older, live in the home as your primary residence, and have sufficient equity. Beverly Hills homes often exceed the FHA limit of $1,149,825, so you may qualify for a proprietary (jumbo) reverse mortgage for higher amounts.
        </p>

        <h3>How much can Beverly Hills seniors get from a reverse mortgage?</h3>
        <p>
          With median home values exceeding $5.5 million in Beverly Hills, seniors can potentially access substantial equity. The FHA HECM limit is $1,149,825, but proprietary reverse mortgages can access higher amounts on luxury properties.
        </p>

        <h3>Are there Beverly Hills reverse mortgage lenders I can trust?</h3>
        <p>
          Working with a wholesale broker provides access to multiple HECM and proprietary reverse mortgage lenders. This allows comparison shopping and finding the best terms for your Beverly Hills property, rather than being limited to one lender's offerings.
        </p>

        <h3>What happens to my Beverly Hills home when I pass away?</h3>
        <p>
          Your heirs have options: sell the home and keep equity above the loan balance, refinance the reverse mortgage, or pay off the loan and keep the home. HECMs are non-recourse loans, meaning heirs never owe more than the home's value.
        </p>

        <h3>How long does a reverse mortgage take in Beverly Hills?</h3>
        <p>
          The reverse mortgage process typically takes 30-45 days from application to closing. HUD-required counseling can be completed in 1-2 weeks, followed by appraisal and underwriting. Luxury properties may require more detailed appraisals.
