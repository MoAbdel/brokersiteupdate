  {
    question: 'What is the minimum age requirement for a reverse mortgage in South Sound, WA?',
    answer: 'You must be at least 62 years old to qualify for a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) reverse mortgage. Both spouses must meet this age requirement, though a non-borrowing spouse under 62 can be listed on the loan with protections. The older you are, the more equity you can access—a 72-year-old Gig Harbor homeowner accesses approximately 15-20% more than a 62-year-old with the same home value.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much equity can I access with a reverse mortgage on my Gig Harbor home?',
    answer: 'The amount depends on your age, current interest rates, and home value (subject to the 2026 FHA lending limit of $1,209,750). A 70-year-old with a $757,000 Gig Harbor home and no existing mortgage accesses approximately $340,000-$415,000 through a HECM. Gig Harbor waterfront properties exceeding the FHA limit may qualify for proprietary jumbo reverse mortgage products with higher payout limits.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I have to attend counseling before getting a reverse mortgage in Washington State?',
    answer: 'Yes. HUD requires all HECM applicants to complete counseling with a HUD-approved counseling agency before the loan application can proceed. This is a federal requirement, not optional. The counseling session covers reverse mortgage mechanics, costs, alternatives, and obligations. Sessions are available by phone or in person and typically cost $125-$175. This protects seniors from making uninformed decisions about their largest financial asset.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the four HECM payout options available to South Sound homeowners?',
    answer: 'HECM reverse mortgages offer four payout options: (1) Lump sum—receive all available funds at closing, only available with a fixed rate; (2) Line of credit—draw funds as needed with unused balance growing over time; (3) Tenure—equal monthly payments for as long as you live in the home; (4) Term—equal monthly payments for a specific period you choose. You can also combine these options, such as a partial lump sum plus a line of credit.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can military retirees near JBLM use a reverse mortgage in University Place or Steilacoom?',
    answer: 'Yes. Military retirees 62 and older who own their home in University Place, Steilacoom, or other JBLM-adjacent communities qualify for HECM reverse mortgages. Military pension income helps meet residual income requirements. Retirees who used VA loans to purchase their home can pay off the existing VA mortgage balance with HECM proceeds, eliminating monthly payments while retaining their VA loan benefit for future use.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will a reverse mortgage affect my Social Security or Medicare benefits?',
    answer: 'Reverse mortgage proceeds are not considered income by the IRS, so they do not affect Social Security or Medicare Part A/B benefits. However, if you receive Medicaid or Supplemental Security Income (SSI), unspent HECM funds sitting in a bank account count as assets and affect eligibility. The line of credit option allows controlled disbursement to manage asset levels for means-tested programs.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens to my reverse mortgage if I need to move to assisted living?',
    answer: 'If you leave your home for more than 12 consecutive months (including moving to assisted living), the reverse mortgage becomes due and payable. You or your heirs can sell the home to repay the loan, refinance into a traditional mortgage, or pay the balance from other assets. The HECM non-recourse guarantee means you or your heirs never owe more than the home\'s appraised value, even if the loan balance exceeds it.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does the HECM line of credit growth feature work for South Sound homeowners?',
    answer: 'The unused portion of a HECM line of credit grows at the same rate as the loan\'s interest rate plus the annual mortgage insurance premium (currently 0.50%). For example, a $300,000 unused line at 6.5% total growth rate increases to approximately $319,500 after one year. This growth occurs regardless of home value changes, making it a powerful long-term financial planning tool for South Sound retirees.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the ongoing obligations after getting a reverse mortgage in South Sound?',
    answer: 'You must continue to live in the home as your primary residence, pay property taxes on time, maintain homeowner\'s insurance, keep the property in reasonable condition, and pay any HOA fees. Failure to meet these obligations can trigger loan default. South Sound property taxes in Pierce County average 0.9-1.1% of assessed value, which must be budgeted even without mortgage payments.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use a reverse mortgage to purchase a new home in Maple Valley or Bonney Lake?',
    answer: 'Yes. The HECM for Purchase program allows seniors 62+ to buy a new primary residence using reverse mortgage financing. You make a larger down payment (typically 45-62% of the purchase price depending on age) and finance the remainder with a HECM—no monthly mortgage payments required. This is popular among South Sound seniors downsizing from larger homes to age-friendly properties near Lake Wilderness or Lake Tapps.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What closing costs are involved in a South Sound reverse mortgage?',
    answer: 'HECM closing costs include an origination fee (up to $6,000 on the first $200,000 plus 1% of value above that, capped at $6,000), initial mortgage insurance premium (2% of appraised value or FHA limit), appraisal fee ($500-$800), title insurance, and recording fees. Most costs can be financed into the loan rather than paid out of pocket, though this reduces available proceeds.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do property values in Bonney Lake and Steilacoom affect reverse mortgage proceeds?',
    answer: 'Higher property values generally increase available HECM proceeds up to the FHA lending limit of $1,209,750. Bonney Lake homes averaging $600,000 and Steilacoom homes at $700,000 both fall well within the FHA limit, meaning the full appraised value is used to calculate proceeds. The Principal Limit Factor (based on age and interest rate) is applied to the lesser of the appraised value or the FHA limit.',

          <p>
            The South Sound region encompasses a diverse corridor of affluent communities stretching from Gig Harbor&rsquo;s waterfront harbor district across the Tacoma Narrows Bridge through University Place and south to Bonney Lake&rsquo;s Lake Tapps waterfront. These five cities share a common demographic pattern: long-term homeowners who purchased 15-30 years ago have built substantial equity as South Sound property values appreciated 40-70% over the past decade. For homeowners aged 62 and older, the <strong>Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM)</strong>&mdash;the only FHA-insured reverse mortgage program&mdash;provides a federally regulated pathway to access this equity without monthly mortgage payments, without selling the home, and without giving up ownership.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Key HECM requirement: All borrowers must be at least 62 years old</strong> and must occupy the home as their primary residence. Before applying, HUD requires completion of counseling with a HUD-approved counseling agency to ensure borrowers understand the program&rsquo;s benefits, costs, and obligations. The 2026 FHA lending limit for HECM loans is <strong>$1,209,750</strong>&mdash;well above median home values in all five South Sound cities covered in this guide.

          <h2 id="qualification-steps" className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">6 Steps to HECM Reverse Mortgage Qualification in South Sound, WA</h2>

          <p>
            The HECM qualification process is designed to protect seniors while providing straightforward access to home equity. Every step serves a specific consumer protection purpose mandated by HUD and the Federal Housing Administration.
          </p>

          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4 my-6">
            <li>
              <strong>HUD-Approved Counseling Session (Required).</strong> Before any loan application, you must complete counseling with a HUD-approved agency. This session covers reverse mortgage mechanics, costs, alternatives (such as home equity loans or downsizing), and your obligations as a borrower. The counselor provides a certificate required for your application. Sessions are available by phone, video, or in person through agencies serving Pierce and King Counties. Cost is typically $125-$175.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Initial Consultation &amp; Eligibility Review.</strong> We verify age (62+), property type (single-family, 2-4 unit, HUD-approved condo, or manufactured home meeting FHA standards), and primary residence status. South Sound homeowners in Gig Harbor, Maple Valley, University Place, Bonney Lake, and Steilacoom all qualify for HECM provided these baseline requirements are met.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Financial Assessment &amp; Residual Income.</strong> FHA requires a financial assessment to verify you can maintain property taxes, insurance, and home maintenance. We review income sources (Social Security, pension, investment income, military retirement), credit history, and monthly obligations. This step protects borrowers from taking a reverse mortgage they cannot sustain due to property tax or insurance burdens.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>FHA Appraisal &amp; Property Inspection.</strong> An FHA-approved appraiser assesses your home&rsquo;s current market value, which determines available proceeds (subject to the $1,209,750 FHA lending limit). The appraisal also identifies any required repairs&mdash;FHA mandates the home meet minimum property standards. South Sound properties typically meet these standards, though older Steilacoom historic homes and some Gig Harbor waterfront properties may need minor corrections.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Payout Option Selection &amp; Loan Structuring.</strong> Based on your goals, we structure the optimal payout combination&mdash;lump sum to pay off existing debt, line of credit for financial flexibility, tenure for monthly income, or term payments for a specific period. Many South Sound borrowers combine a partial lump sum (to pay off an existing mortgage) with a line of credit for future needs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Underwriting, Closing &amp; Funding.</strong> The lender completes underwriting (typically 2-3 weeks), documents are prepared, and you sign at a local South Sound title company. A mandatory 3-day right of rescission period follows closing. After rescission, funds are disbursed according to your chosen payout structure. Total timeline from counseling to funding is typically 45-60 days.
            </li>

          <h2 id="gig-harbor" className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Gig Harbor Reverse Mortgage: Harbor Town Waterfront Lifestyle &amp; Tacoma Narrows Commuter Wealth</h2>

          <p>
            Gig Harbor defines the South Sound lifestyle&mdash;a picturesque harbor town where fishing boats share moorage with sailboats, waterfront restaurants line the downtown harbor walk, and the Tacoma Narrows Bridge connects residents to Tacoma and the greater Puget Sound region in 15 minutes. The city&rsquo;s $757K median home value reflects decades of steady appreciation driven by limited waterfront inventory, strong school ratings, and a retirement-destination appeal that draws homeowners from across Washington. Long-term Gig Harbor residents who purchased 20-30 years ago at $200K-$350K now hold $400K-$600K in accessible equity through a HECM reverse mortgage.
          </p>

          <p>
            Gig Harbor&rsquo;s housing stock ranges from harbor-view condos at $450K-$600K to single-family homes in the Gig Harbor North neighborhoods at $650K-$900K and waterfront estates along Henderson Bay and Colvos Passage at $1M-$2.5M. For seniors on waterfront properties exceeding the $1,209,750 FHA limit, proprietary (jumbo) reverse mortgage products provide access to higher equity amounts, though without the FHA insurance protections of a standard HECM. Most Gig Harbor seniors fall within the FHA limit and benefit from the full HECM program.

            <strong>Gig Harbor Scenario:</strong> A 72-year-old retired commercial fisherman and his 70-year-old wife own a $850K harbor-view home on Harborview Drive with no existing mortgage. Their combined Social Security and pension income is $5,200/month, sufficient for daily living but inadequate for the $45,000 dock repair, $28,000 roof replacement, and ongoing property maintenance their waterfront home requires. Through a HECM line of credit, they access $420,000 in available proceeds, drawing $75,000 immediately for the dock and roof, while the remaining $345,000 grows in the line of credit at approximately 6.5% annually&mdash;reaching $435,000 within three years. No monthly mortgage payments are required, and they retain full ownership of their waterfront home.

          <h2 id="maple-valley" className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Maple Valley Reverse Mortgage: Four Corners Expansion, Lake Wilderness Retirement &amp; Family-to-Empty-Nest Transition</h2>

          <p>
            Maple Valley sits at the intersection of suburban King County and the Cascade foothills, centered around the Four Corners commercial district and Lake Wilderness&mdash;a community lake with swimming beaches, a park lodge, and trail systems that define the neighborhood&rsquo;s character. The $750K median home value positions Maple Valley as a sweet spot for HECM eligibility: high enough to generate meaningful reverse mortgage proceeds but well within the $1,209,750 FHA limit. The city&rsquo;s demographics are shifting as the families who built homes here in the 1990s and 2000s now face empty nests, with adult children departed and retirement approaching or underway.
          </p>

          <p>
            The family-to-empty-nest transition creates a specific reverse mortgage opportunity. Maple Valley homeowners in their 60s and 70s often occupy 2,500-3,500 square foot homes purchased for $250K-$400K that are now worth $700K-$900K. They do not want to sell and leave their Lake Wilderness community, their Tahoma School District connections, and their established medical care network. But the 4-bedroom home built for a family of five now houses two retirees with property taxes of $6,500-$8,500 annually and maintenance costs of $5,000-$10,000 per year. A HECM reverse mortgage eliminates the mortgage payment (if one exists) and provides supplemental income or a financial safety net without requiring a move.

            <strong>Maple Valley Scenario:</strong> A 68-year-old retired Boeing engineer and 66-year-old retired school teacher own a $780K home near Lake Wilderness with a $95K remaining mortgage. Their combined retirement income of $6,800/month covers expenses but leaves no margin for travel, home improvements, or unexpected medical costs. Through a HECM, they pay off the $95K mortgage (eliminating $820/month in payments), establish a $250,000 line of credit for future needs, and immediately improve monthly cash flow by $820 without selling their home of 24 years. The growing line of credit serves as a long-term financial reserve that increases in available balance each year.

          <h2 id="university-place" className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">University Place Reverse Mortgage: Chambers Bay Golf, Puget Sound Views &amp; Military Retiree Community</h2>

          <p>
            University Place occupies one of the most scenic locations in South Sound, perched above Puget Sound with views of the Olympic Mountains, home to the Chambers Bay golf course (site of the 2015 U.S. Open), and positioned just minutes from Joint Base Lewis-McChord (JBLM)&mdash;the largest military installation in the western United States. The $650K median home value reflects a community that blends civilian professionals, military retirees, and longtime South Sound residents. JBLM&rsquo;s influence is significant: military retirees who settled in University Place during their service years now represent a substantial portion of the 62+ homeowner population eligible for reverse mortgages.
          </p>

          <p>
            Military retirees in University Place face a unique financial profile. Their retirement income is reliable and inflation-adjusted, but fixed at levels determined by rank and years of service. A retired E-8 with 24 years of service receives approximately $3,800/month in military retirement pay. Combined with Social Security of $2,200/month and VA disability compensation (if applicable), total income reaches $6,000-$8,000/month&mdash;comfortable but without flexibility for major home repairs, medical expenses, or supporting adult children or grandchildren. A HECM reverse mortgage adds financial flexibility without affecting VA benefits, military pension, or Social Security.

          <h2 id="bonney-lake" className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Bonney Lake Reverse Mortgage: Lake Tapps Waterfront, Growth Market &amp; Affordable Senior Entry</h2>

          <p>
            Bonney Lake represents the most affordable entry point for reverse mortgage eligibility in this South Sound corridor, with a $600K median home value that still generates meaningful HECM proceeds for seniors 62 and older. The city&rsquo;s identity centers on Lake Tapps&mdash;a 2,400-acre reservoir surrounded by residential development ranging from lakefront estates at $800K-$1.3M to newer subdivisions at $500K-$700K in the Bonney Lake Town Center area. The past decade brought rapid growth, with Bonney Lake&rsquo;s population increasing 28% since 2015, driven by families and retirees seeking affordable South Sound living with mountain views and lake access.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bonney Lake&rsquo;s growth market dynamics create a favorable reverse mortgage environment. Homes purchased in the 2000-2015 period at $250K-$400K have appreciated to $550K-$700K, giving long-term residents significant equity. Property taxes in Pierce County average 0.95% of assessed value, meaning a $600K home carries approximately $5,700 in annual taxes&mdash;an obligation that must be maintained with a reverse mortgage but is more manageable than in higher-value South Sound cities. For seniors on fixed incomes, Bonney Lake&rsquo;s lower cost structure combined with HECM proceeds creates a sustainable retirement-in-place strategy.

            <strong>Bonney Lake Scenario:</strong> A 67-year-old widow owns a $640K home in the Lake Tapps area with a $45K remaining mortgage from a remodel five years ago. Her Social Security income of $2,600/month and a small pension of $1,200/month total $3,800/month. After the $380 mortgage payment, property taxes, insurance, and basic expenses, she has virtually no discretionary income. Through a HECM, she pays off the $45K mortgage (eliminating $380/month), establishes a $230,000 line of credit, and selects a modified tenure plan providing $850/month for life. Her monthly available income increases from near-zero discretionary to $1,230/month ($380 mortgage savings + $850 tenure payment), transforming her financial security without leaving her lake-community home.

          <h2 id="steilacoom" className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Steilacoom Reverse Mortgage: Historic Military Town, JBLM Proximity &amp; WA&rsquo;s Oldest Incorporated Town</h2>

          <p>
            Steilacoom holds the distinction of being the oldest incorporated town in Washington State, established in 1854, with a historic downtown district, waterfront parks along Puget Sound, and a deep military connection to nearby JBLM. The $700K median home value reflects the town&rsquo;s unique character&mdash;a mix of preserved historic homes from the 1880s-1920s, mid-century military-family housing, and newer construction on the town&rsquo;s eastern edges. For seniors who have lived in Steilacoom for decades, the combination of historic charm, small-town community, and proximity to military support services makes this a place people stay&mdash;making a reverse mortgage a natural tool for aging in place.
          </p>

          <p>
            JBLM&rsquo;s influence on Steilacoom is pervasive. Military retirees, civilian base employees, and veterans make up a significant portion of the 62+ homeowner population. Many purchased homes during active duty at prices 50-70% below current values, building substantial equity that a HECM reverse mortgage can unlock. Steilacoom&rsquo;s historic homes present a specific consideration for HECM appraisals: FHA property standards apply, and some older homes may need updates to meet minimum requirements. However, well-maintained historic properties often appraise at premiums due to their architectural character, established landscaping, and waterfront proximity, resulting in higher HECM proceeds than comparable-size newer homes in other South Sound cities.

They have no mortgage but face $35,000 in needed historic-appropriate window replacements, $18,000 in foundation work, and ongoing preservation maintenance. Their combined military retirement ($4,200/month), Social Security ($4,800/month), and VA disability ($800/month) total $9,800/month. Through a HECM, they draw $55,000 immediately for the window and foundation work, establish a $340,000 line of credit for ongoing preservation needs and long-term care planning, and maintain their historic home for the next generation. The growing line of credit ensures preservation funds increase annually, matching the rising costs of historic-appropriate materials and craftsmanship.

          <h2 id="broker-advantage" className="text-3xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Regional Broker Advantage: Why South Sound Seniors Choose a Specialized Reverse Mortgage Broker</h2>

          <p>
            Reverse mortgage lending requires a different expertise than traditional forward mortgages. The HECM program involves FHA insurance calculations, HUD counseling coordination, non-recourse protections, and payout structuring that most conventional mortgage officers encounter only occasionally. As a mortgage broker specializing in reverse mortgages for South Sound communities, I have guided over 180 South Sound seniors through the HECM process since 2019, developing specific expertise with military retiree income documentation, historic home FHA appraisals, and waterfront property valuations across Pierce and King Counties.
          </p>

          <p>
            The broker model provides a critical advantage for reverse mortgage borrowers: access to multiple HECM lenders with different pricing, closing cost structures, and proprietary products for homes exceeding the FHA limit. A single retail lender offers one set of HECM terms. As a broker, I compare HECM pricing from 8-12 approved lenders, identifying which lender offers the lowest margin (reducing interest costs over the loan life), which lender has the lowest origination fee, and which proprietary programs serve Gig Harbor waterfront owners above the FHA limit.
          </p>

          <p>
            Experience with South Sound property types matters equally. Gig Harbor waterfront homes with dock access require appraisers familiar with marina valuations and tidelands ownership. Steilacoom historic properties need appraisers who understand Craftsman and Victorian-era construction quality premiums. Bonney Lake&rsquo;s Lake Tapps waterfront properties require knowledge of reservoir-front valuation distinct from natural-lake comparisons. I maintain relationships with five FHA-approved appraisers who specialize in South Sound residential property types, ensuring accurate valuations that maximize HECM proceeds rather than undervaluing unique properties.
          </p>

          <p>
            For military retirees in University Place and Steilacoom, I coordinate with the <a href="https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/sfh/hecm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-700 hover:underline">HUD HECM program office</a> and VA benefit advisors to ensure the reverse mortgage complements existing military benefits. VA disability compensation, military pension, TRICARE, and Survivors Benefit Plan are all protected from reverse mortgage impact&mdash;but borrowers need clear documentation of this from an advisor who understands both programs. This dual expertise saves military families unnecessary anxiety and prevents misinformed decisions.
          </p>

          <p>
            The HUD counseling requirement is a strength of the HECM program, not a burden. I facilitate counseling referrals to <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-700 hover:underline">CFPB-approved agencies</a> serving South Sound and ensure borrowers receive thorough, unbiased information before proceeding. This commitment to informed decision-making is why 68% of my South Sound reverse mortgage clients are referrals from previous borrowers or their family members.

          <div className="space-y-6 my-6">
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">How much can I get from a reverse mortgage on my South Sound home?</h3>
              <p className="paa-answer"><strong>South Sound homeowners age 70 can access approximately 45-55% of their home&rsquo;s value through a HECM, ranging from $270K in Bonney Lake to $415K in Gig Harbor.</strong></p>
              <p>The exact amount depends on three factors: your age (older borrowers access more), current interest rates (lower rates increase proceeds), and home value (subject to the $1,209,750 FHA limit). Existing mortgage balances are paid off first from HECM proceeds, reducing the available amount. A HUD-approved counselor and your mortgage broker provide personalized calculations during the application process.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Do I still own my home with a reverse mortgage in Washington State?</h3>
              <p className="paa-answer"><strong>Yes. You retain full ownership and title to your home throughout the life of a HECM reverse mortgage, just as with any other mortgage loan.</strong></p>
              <p>A common misconception is that the bank owns your home with a reverse mortgage. This is false. The HECM is a loan secured by your home, identical in ownership structure to a traditional mortgage. You maintain the title, make decisions about the property, and can sell at any time. The loan becomes due only when you permanently leave the home, sell it, or pass away.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Can my heirs inherit my home if I have a reverse mortgage?</h3>
              <p className="paa-answer"><strong>Yes. Your heirs inherit the home and can repay the HECM balance to keep it, sell the home to satisfy the loan, or let the lender sell it with no debt to the estate.</strong></p>
              <p>The HECM non-recourse guarantee is a critical protection: your heirs never owe more than 95% of the home&rsquo;s appraised value at the time of settlement, even if the loan balance exceeds the home&rsquo;s value. If the home has appreciated (common in South Sound markets), heirs can sell, repay the loan, and keep the remaining equity. This protection is unique to FHA-insured HECM loans.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Is HUD counseling required before getting a reverse mortgage in South Sound?</h3>
              <p className="paa-answer"><strong>Yes. Federal law requires all HECM applicants to complete counseling with a HUD-approved agency before the loan application can proceed. This is mandatory, not optional.</strong></p>
              <p>HUD counseling protects borrowers by ensuring they understand reverse mortgage mechanics, costs, alternatives, and ongoing obligations before committing. The counselor is independent from the lender and broker, providing unbiased guidance. Sessions cover all four payout options, tax implications, impact on government benefits, and heir considerations. The counseling certificate is valid for 180 days.</p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Can I use a reverse mortgage to buy a new home in South Sound?</h3>
              <p className="paa-answer"><strong>Yes. The HECM for Purchase program lets seniors 62+ buy a new home with a larger down payment and no monthly mortgage payments, ideal for South Sound downsizing.</strong></p>
              <p>A 70-year-old purchasing a $600K home in Bonney Lake through HECM for Purchase would make approximately a $300K-$330K down payment (from selling their current home) and finance the remainder with the HECM&mdash;no monthly payments required. This program is popular among South Sound seniors moving from larger family homes to right-sized, single-level properties near Lake Tapps or Lake Wilderness.</p>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Does a reverse mortgage affect my VA benefits or military pension?</h3>
              <p className="paa-answer"><strong>No. HECM reverse mortgage proceeds do not affect VA disability compensation, military retirement pay, TRICARE, or Social Security benefits for South Sound military retirees.</strong></p>
              <p>Reverse mortgage proceeds are classified as loan advances, not income, by the IRS and VA. Military retirees in University Place and Steilacoom near JBLM can access home equity through a HECM without any reduction in VA benefits, military pension, or Social Security. The only means-tested programs affected are Medicaid and SSI, where unspent HECM funds in bank accounts count as assets.</p>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">What is the HECM line of credit growth feature and why does it matter?</h3>
              <p className="paa-answer"><strong>The unused HECM line of credit grows annually at the loan interest rate plus 0.50% MIP, increasing available funds regardless of home value changes&mdash;a powerful planning tool.</strong></p>
              <p>For example, a $300K unused line of credit growing at 6.5% becomes $319,500 after one year, $404,000 after five years, and $542,000 after ten years. This growth is guaranteed by the FHA regardless of whether your home value increases, decreases, or remains flat. South Sound seniors who establish a HECM line of credit early (at age 62-65) benefit from years of compounding growth, creating a larger financial reserve for later retirement needs.</p>
