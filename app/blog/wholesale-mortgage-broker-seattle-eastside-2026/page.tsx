            The Seattle Eastside mortgage market demands more than a banker who fills out forms. With median home prices exceeding $1.5 million across most Eastside cities, complex tech compensation packages from Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta, and property values ranging from $1 million to $15 million+, Eastside homebuyers need a wholesale mortgage broker who understands the nuances of this market and has the lender relationships to deliver results. As a wholesale broker with access to over 200 lenders, I bring the entire lending marketplace to your fingertips — comparing rates, terms, programs, and qualification methodologies to find the optimal mortgage for your specific situation.
          </p>

          <p>
            This guide covers the wholesale mortgage broker advantage for all 14 Seattle Eastside cities, with particular focus on tech income qualification, jumbo loan programs, and the specialized lending solutions that Eastside homebuyers and homeowners require. Whether you are an Amazon L7 relocating to Bellevue, a Microsoft principal engineer buying in Sammamish, a Google manager purchasing in Kirkland, or a startup founder looking for a bank statement loan in Redmond, wholesale broker access transforms your mortgage experience from limited to unlimited.

          <p>
            The math is straightforward. On a $1.5 million Bellevue jumbo mortgage, a wholesale rate advantage saves $200 to $500 or more per month compared to retail bank pricing. Over a 30-year loan, that translates to $72,000 to $180,000 in total savings. Add Washington State&apos;s zero income tax advantage, and Eastside homebuyers retain more money per transaction than homebuyers in virtually any other major tech hub in the country.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Tech Income Qualification: How Wholesale Brokers Maximize Eastside Buyer Power</h2>
          <p>
            The single biggest challenge for Seattle Eastside homebuyers is income qualification. Tech compensation packages are unlike any other industry: base salary may represent only 40-60% of total compensation, with the remainder consisting of RSUs, stock options, signing bonuses, annual bonuses, and other equity-based pay. How a lender calculates this income directly determines how much home you can afford — and lender methodologies vary wildly.

            <strong>The wholesale difference in real numbers:</strong> Consider an Amazon L7 (Senior Manager) relocating to Bellevue with $250K base salary, $300K in annual RSU vesting, $75K target bonus, and $100K signing bonus. A conservative bank counts only the $250K base — qualifying for roughly a $1.2M purchase. A best-fit wholesale lender counts $250K base + $300K RSU average + $50K bonus average = $600K qualifying income — unlocking a $2.8M+ purchase. Same buyer, same income, completely different outcome based on lender selection.

              <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Amazon Employees (Bellevue, Redmond)</h3>
              <p className="mb-2">Amazon&apos;s compensation structure is unique: base salary caps around $175K-$185K with heavy RSU loading, especially at L6+ levels. RSUs vest on a back-loaded schedule (5% year 1, 15% year 2, 40% year 3-4) that complicates income averaging.</p>
              <p><strong>Wholesale broker solution:</strong> We use lenders who calculate Amazon RSU income using a forward-looking vesting schedule rather than a 2-year lookback, which benefits employees in years 3-4 of their vesting cycle. For recent Amazon hires (L6+), we pair with lenders who count the offer letter total compensation to maximize purchasing power before full vesting history exists.</p>

              <p className="mb-2">Microsoft provides a more balanced compensation mix: competitive base salary, annual stock awards (vesting quarterly), and performance bonuses. The quarterly vesting creates consistent income that lenders handle more easily.</p>
              <p><strong>Wholesale broker solution:</strong> Microsoft&apos;s quarterly RSU vesting creates a strong, documentable income history. We use lenders who count both the base and the 2-year RSU average at full value, plus the annual bonus as documented on tax returns. For Microsoft executives relocating from other offices, we pre-approve based on the offer letter before they arrive on campus — closing within 21-30 days of finding a home.</p>

Monthly vesting provides the most consistent RSU income stream for mortgage qualification.</p>
              <p><strong>Wholesale broker solution:</strong> Google&apos;s monthly GSU vesting is the most lender-friendly structure among major Eastside employers. We leverage this with lenders who count current annual GSU value rather than requiring a 2-year history, which benefits recently promoted or hired Google employees. Kirkland purchases typically fall in the $1.1M-$1.8M range, aligning with both conforming high-balance and jumbo products.</p>

              <p><strong>Wholesale broker solution:</strong> We pair Meta employees with lenders experienced in qualifying quarterly-vesting RSUs and who accept Meta stock at current market value rather than requiring historical exercise data. For Meta employees who joined during a stock price dip, we use lenders that calculate RSU income based on current stock price rather than the lower historical vesting price, maximizing qualifying income.</p>

            <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-3">The Situation</h3>
            <p className="mb-3">Sarah, an Amazon L7 (Senior Manager), is relocating from the Bay Area to Bellevue. She has been at Amazon for 18 months with the following compensation: $185K base salary, $800K in RSUs vesting over 4 years (year 1: 5% = $40K, year 2: 15% = $120K, year 3: 40% = $320K, year 4: 40% = $320K), $80K signing bonus received, and $50K target annual bonus.</p>

            <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-3">The Bank Approach</h3>
            <p className="mb-3">Her current bank at Chase counts only her $185K base salary and the $40K in year-1 RSU vesting received so far. Total qualifying income: $225K. Maximum purchase with 20% down: approximately $1.1M. This eliminates 70% of Bellevue homes from consideration.</p>

            <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-3">The Wholesale Broker Approach</h3>
            <p className="mb-3">We identify a wholesale lender that uses the full 4-year RSU vesting schedule annualized ($200K/year average), adds the $185K base and $40K bonus average. Total qualifying income: $425K. Maximum purchase with 20% down: approximately $2.1M. This opens virtually the entire Bellevue market.</p>

            <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-3">The Result</h3>
            <p>Sarah purchases a $1.85M home in Somerset with 20% down ($370K). The wholesale rate saves her $320/month compared to the retail rate Chase offered on a lower loan amount. Over 7 years (the average Eastside hold period), she saves $26,880 in interest payments — plus she lives in the home she actually wanted rather than settling for a lesser property.</p>

His new compensation package: $300K base, $500K in annual RSU grants, $200K target bonus. He has $2M in liquid assets and wants to purchase a $2.5M home in Education Hill. He has not started the new role yet and has no US income history.</p>

            <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-3">The Challenge</h3>
            <p className="mb-3">Most banks require 30 days of pay stubs from the new role, plus a 2-year income history in the same line of work. David has neither US pay stubs nor US-based income history, despite being a senior Microsoft executive for 12 years internationally.</p>

            <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-3">The Wholesale Broker Solution</h3>
            <p className="mb-3">We match David with a portfolio lender that accepts the Microsoft offer letter as proof of income, uses his international Microsoft tenure as employment history, and counts the full $1M compensation package for qualification. Additionally, his $2M in liquid assets provides a 12-month reserve buffer that satisfies the lender&apos;s jumbo requirements.</p>

            <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-3">The Result</h3>
            <p>David closes on his $2.5M Redmond home within 28 days of offer acceptance. The wholesale rate is competitive with domestic borrowers, and the process is seamless despite the international relocation complexity. His family moves directly from temporary housing into their permanent home without delays.</p>

            <p className="mb-3">Alex is the founder and CEO of a Series B startup with offices in downtown Kirkland. The company generates $8M in annual revenue, but Alex takes a modest $120K salary while reinvesting profits. His personal tax returns show $120K income for the past two years. He wants to purchase a $1.4M home in the Houghton neighborhood.</p>

            <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-3">The Challenge</h3>
            <p className="mb-3">Based on tax return income of $120K, a conventional mortgage qualifies Alex for approximately $580K — less than half the purchase price. His actual economic capacity is far higher, but the tax returns do not reflect it.</p>

            <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-3">The Wholesale Broker Solution</h3>
            <p className="mb-3">We use a bank statement loan program that calculates income from 12 months of personal bank deposits. Alex&apos;s bank statements show $350K in annual deposits (salary, distributions, consulting income, investment returns). The lender uses 80% of average monthly deposits as qualifying income, resulting in $280K annual qualifying income. With a 25% down payment, Alex qualifies for the $1.4M purchase.</p>

            <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-3">The Result</h3>
            <p>Alex purchases his Kirkland home using a bank statement program accessed through wholesale broker channels. The rate carries a modest premium over conventional pricing, but the flexibility to qualify on actual cash flow rather than tax return income makes the purchase possible. No other bank he approached could offer this solution.</p>

          <div className="space-y-6 my-6">
            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
              <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">What is a wholesale mortgage broker on the Seattle Eastside?</h3>
              <p>A wholesale mortgage broker is an independent licensed professional who shops your mortgage across 200+ wholesale lenders to find the best rate and terms. Unlike a bank loan officer who offers only that bank&apos;s products, a wholesale broker represents you in the lending marketplace, creating competition among lenders for your business. This results in lower rates, more product options, and better overall terms.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
              <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">How does a wholesale broker qualify Amazon RSU income for a mortgage?</h3>
              <p>RSU qualification varies significantly by lender, which is why wholesale broker access matters. The most favorable lenders for Amazon employees count vested RSUs using a 2-year average at the stock price on vesting date. Some lenders also provide partial credit for unvested RSUs. We match Amazon employees with the lender whose RSU methodology maximizes their qualifying income — often resulting in $100K-$200K more income recognition compared to a conservative bank calculation.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
              <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Can a wholesale broker get better rates than Chase or Bank of America on the Eastside?</h3>
              <p>Yes, consistently. Wholesale rates are structurally lower than retail bank rates because wholesale lenders operate with lower overhead and compete against 200+ other lenders for every loan. A large bank offers one rate — theirs — with no competitive pressure. On a $1.5M Bellevue jumbo mortgage, this rate advantage saves $200-$500+ per month, or $72,000-$180,000 over the life of a 30-year loan.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
              <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">What types of loans does a wholesale mortgage broker offer on the Eastside?</h3>
              <p>Every type. Through 200+ lender partners, we offer conventional, jumbo ($10M+), FHA, VA, bank statement loans, DSCR investment property loans, asset depletion loans, non-QM, bridge loans, construction loans, HELOCs, HELOANs, cash-out refinances, and reverse mortgages (HECM and jumbo). This comprehensive product access ensures the right solution exists for every Eastside buyer and homeowner.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
              <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">How does a wholesale broker help startup founders get mortgages on the Eastside?</h3>
              <p>Startup founders face unique challenges: variable compensation, equity-heavy packages, business deductions that reduce taxable income, and sometimes minimal W-2 income. Wholesale brokers access bank statement loan programs (using 12-24 months of deposits instead of tax returns), asset depletion loans (using liquid assets to calculate income), and portfolio lenders who evaluate total financial picture. These solutions are rarely available through retail banks.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
              <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">What is the maximum jumbo loan amount available on the Seattle Eastside?</h3>

              <p>Microsoft employees relocating to the Eastside benefit from fast pre-approval using an offer letter (before starting the new role), RSU income counting from the compensation package, relocation stipend consideration as assets, and access to lenders deeply familiar with Microsoft&apos;s compensation structure. We have closed relocation purchases in as little as 21 days from contract to keys, allowing families to settle quickly.</p>

              <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">What is a bank statement loan and who qualifies on the Eastside?</h3>
              <p>A bank statement loan uses 12-24 months of personal or business bank statements to verify income instead of tax returns. Qualifying income is calculated as a percentage (typically 50-100%) of average monthly deposits. This program serves self-employed Eastside professionals, startup founders, consultants, freelancers, and business owners whose tax returns understate their true earning capacity due to legitimate business deductions.</p>

              <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">How fast can a wholesale broker close a mortgage on the Eastside?</h3>
              <p>Wholesale brokers close conventional and jumbo purchases on the Eastside in 21-30 days as standard timeline. Rush closings in 14-17 days are achievable with complete documentation readiness, cooperative sellers, and priority appraisal scheduling. Refinances typically close in 25-35 days. Parallel processing of documentation, appraisal, and title work compresses timelines versus sequential bank processing.</p>

              <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Does a wholesale broker charge more fees than a bank?</h3>
              <p>No. Wholesale broker fees are comparable to or lower than retail bank fees. Broker compensation is fully disclosed on your Loan Estimate as required by federal law. Because wholesale lenders have lower origination costs than retail banks (no branches, no retail overhead), the total cost of a wholesale loan — including rate, fees, and closing costs — is typically lower than a comparable bank loan with similar terms.</p>

              <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Can a wholesale broker help me buy an investment property on the Eastside?</h3>
              <p>Yes. We access investment property programs including conventional investment mortgages (up to 10 financed properties), DSCR loans (qualifying on rental income alone, not personal income), portfolio loans for unique situations, and bridge financing for fix-and-flip or value-add strategies. For Eastside tech professionals building rental portfolios, DSCR loans are especially popular because they do not affect personal debt-to-income ratios.</p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-green-900 mb-3">Expert Summary: Wholesale Mortgage Broker Advantage on the Seattle Eastside</h2>
            <p className="text-slate-900 mb-3">
              The Seattle Eastside mortgage market is defined by high property values, complex tech compensation, and fierce buyer competition. In this environment, a wholesale mortgage broker provides advantages that retail banks structurally cannot match: access to 200+ lenders, expert tech income qualification, jumbo and super-jumbo expertise up to $10M+, and rates that consistently beat retail bank pricing by $200-$500+ per month on typical Eastside jumbo loans.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-900 mb-3">
              For Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta employees, the wholesale broker difference is measured in purchasing power. The right lender counts your RSU income at full value, qualifies your bonus at offer letter amounts, and processes your offer letter for pre-approval before your first day of work. The wrong lender — typically a retail bank with one qualification methodology — leaves $500K-$1M in purchasing power on the table.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-900">
              Combined with Washington State&apos;s zero income tax, the wholesale broker advantage on the Eastside amounts to $45,000-$48,000+ per year in total financial benefit compared to a California retail bank transaction. Whether you are buying your first Eastside home, upgrading to a larger property, or investing in rental real estate, wholesale broker access transforms your mortgage from a commodity into a strategic financial advantage.
