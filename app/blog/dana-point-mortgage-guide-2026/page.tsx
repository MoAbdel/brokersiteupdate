                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3>What credit score do I need for a Dana Point mortgage?</h3>
                <p>
                    Minimum credit score requirements vary by loan program. FHA loans may accept scores as low as 580 with 3.5% down, conventional loans typically require 620+, and jumbo loans often require 680-700+ for optimal pricing. Higher credit scores generally qualify for more competitive terms. Individual circumstances vary, so contact a licensed loan officer for personalized guidance.
                </p>

                <h3>Can I buy a Dana Point property with zero down payment?</h3>
                <p>
                    VA loans offer zero down payment options for eligible veterans and active military. Some conventional programs offer 3% down for first-time buyers, and FHA loans require 3.5% down. Down payment assistance programs may be available for qualified buyers. Contact a licensed loan officer to explore your options.
                </p>

                <h3>How long does it take to close on a Dana Point home?</h3>
                <p>
                    Typical closing timelines range from 30-45 days, though this can vary based on loan complexity, property type, and current market conditions. Wholesale brokers often provide faster processing than large retail banks due to streamlined operations and direct lender relationships.
                </p>

                <h3>Can I finance an investment property in Dana Point?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes, investment property financing is available through wholesale channels. Investment properties typically require larger down payments (20-25%) and may have slightly different pricing than primary residence loans. Dana Point's strong rental market and tourism appeal make it attractive for investment purposes.
                </p>

                <h3>What's the difference between pre-qualification and pre-approval?</h3>
                <p>
                    Pre-qualification is an informal estimate based on self-reported information. Pre-approval involves submitting documentation (income verification, assets, credit report) and receiving conditional approval from a lender. In Dana Point's competitive market, sellers strongly prefer buyers with comprehensive pre-approval letters.
                </p>

                <h3>Can I refinance my current Dana Point home?</h3>
                <p>
                    Absolutely. Wholesale brokers handle both purchase and refinance transactions. Whether you're looking to reduce your monthly payment, access equity through a cash-out refinance, or switch from an adjustable to fixed-rate mortgage, wholesale channels can provide competitive options.
                </p>

                <h3>Are there special programs for first-time homebuyers in Dana Point?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes, first-time buyers may qualify for programs including FHA loans with 3.5% down, conventional loans with 3% down, and various down payment assistance programs. Orange County and California offer additional resources for first-time buyers. A licensed loan officer can help identify programs you may qualify for.
