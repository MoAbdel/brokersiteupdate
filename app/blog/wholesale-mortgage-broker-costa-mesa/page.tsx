            Costa Mesa sits at the heart of Orange County with a unique blend of beachy culture, established neighborhoods, and urban amenities. The city's median home price of approximately <strong>$1.1 million</strong> means most buyers benefit significantly from wholesale mortgage access, while premium Mesa Verde properties reaching <strong>$2 million or more</strong> require jumbo loan expertise. A <strong>wholesale mortgage broker</strong> provides access to institutional rates from 200+ lenders, bank statement programs for Costa Mesa's entrepreneurial community, and specialty financing for condos near South Coast Plaza. On typical Costa Mesa purchases, wholesale rates represent <strong>$55,000-$110,000+</strong> in potential savings compared to retail bank pricing.

        <p>
          Costa Mesa occupies a unique position in Orange County's real estate landscape. Bordered by Newport Beach to the south, Huntington Beach to the west, and Irvine to the east, Costa Mesa offers proximity to coastal lifestyle without coastal prices—though that gap has narrowed significantly. The city's transformation over the past two decades from a working-class community to a sought-after address for young professionals, families, and creative entrepreneurs has driven substantial appreciation.

          Costa Mesa's economy is anchored by South Coast Plaza—one of the nation's premier shopping destinations—along with a thriving arts scene centered around the Segerstrom Center for the Arts, a growing restaurant and brewery culture, and substantial office space in South Coast Metro. This diverse economic base supports a population with varied income profiles, many of whom benefit from wholesale mortgage programs that accommodate non-traditional documentation.

        <h3>The Eastside-Westside Divide</h3>

        <p id="eastside-westside">
          Understanding Costa Mesa requires understanding its east-west dynamics. The city is roughly divided by the 55 freeway into two distinct markets:
        </p>

        <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 my-6">
          <div className="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-xl">

            <p className="text-sm mb-2"><strong>Price Range:</strong> $800K - $1.5M</p>
            <p className="text-sm mb-0">Charming bungalows, mid-century homes, tree-lined streets. Proximity to Newport Beach drives values. Popular with young professionals and families seeking character homes. Strong appreciation trajectory.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-xl">
            <h4 className="mt-0 text-green-900">Westside Costa Mesa</h4>
            <p className="text-sm mb-2"><strong>Price Range:</strong> $700K - $1.1M</p>
            <p className="text-sm mb-0">More affordable entry point. Growing arts and dining scene. First-time buyer opportunities. Proximity to Huntington Beach and 405 freeway. Active renovation and infill market.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          This geographic divide affects financing needs: Eastside buyers often face prices approaching or exceeding conforming limits, while Westside buyers may find more conventional loan options. Both sides see demand for bank statement programs given Costa Mesa's entrepreneurial culture.

        <p>
          Mesa Verde is Costa Mesa's premier neighborhood, known for large homes, tree-lined streets, excellent schools, and a strong sense of community. The area features custom homes, many on spacious lots with pools, and attracts families seeking top-tier education in the Newport-Mesa Unified School District.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Financing considerations for Mesa Verde:</strong>
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Jumbo expertise essential:</strong> Nearly all Mesa Verde purchases exceed conforming limits</li>
          <li><strong>Bank statement programs popular:</strong> High concentration of business owners and executives</li>
          <li><strong>Super jumbo availability:</strong> Premium properties above $2 million require specialty lenders</li>
          <li><strong>Asset-based options:</strong> Retired executives and investors with substantial assets but retirement income</li>
          <li><strong>Rate sensitivity:</strong> On $1.5M+ loans, even small rate differences mean significant dollars</li>

        <p>
          Eastside Costa Mesa features smaller-lot single-family homes, many with original mid-century character that buyers cherish. The neighborhood's proximity to Newport Beach—some areas are walking distance to the Back Bay—drives premium pricing for its size. The Eastside has become a magnet for creative professionals, tech workers, and young families priced out of Newport Beach.

        <p>
          <strong>Financing considerations for Eastside:</strong>
        </p>

          <li><strong>Renovation considerations:</strong> Older homes may need updates; renovation loan options available</li>

This transformation has attracted artists, entrepreneurs, and first-time buyers seeking urban amenities at relatively lower prices.
