        <h2>What Are Non-QM Loans?</h2>
        <p>
          Non-QM loans fall outside the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's "qualified mortgage" definition:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Alternative documentation:</strong> Verify income without traditional methods</li>
          <li><strong>Non-traditional borrowers:</strong> Self-employed, investors, foreign nationals</li>
          <li><strong>Private investors:</strong> Not sold to Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac</li>
          <li><strong>Specialized underwriting:</strong> Programs designed for specific situations</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Banks Don't Offer Most Non-QM Programs</h2>
        <p>
          Banks focus on qualified mortgages for several reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Secondary market focus:</strong> Banks want to sell loans to GSEs</li>
          <li><strong>Risk tolerance:</strong> Non-QM requires higher risk appetite</li>
          <li><strong>Specialized knowledge:</strong> Each program requires specific expertise</li>
          <li><strong>Private investor relationships:</strong> Banks don't have these connections</li>
          <li><strong>Volume focus:</strong> Banks prefer standardized products</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>What is a non-QM loan?</h3>
        <p>
          Non-QM (non-qualified mortgage) loans are mortgages that don't meet the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's qualified mortgage guidelines. They serve borrowers with non-traditional income, credit situations, or investment goals who can't qualify for conventional loans.
        </p>

        <h3>Why can't banks offer most non-QM loans?</h3>
        <p>
          Banks primarily offer qualified mortgages they can sell to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Non-QM loans require private investors, specialized underwriting, and higher risk tolerance that most banks don't have. Wholesale brokers access 100+ non-QM lenders banks don't work with.
        </p>

        <h3>What types of non-QM loans are available?</h3>
        <p>
          Non-QM loans include bank statement loans, DSCR investment loans, asset depletion, interest-only programs, foreign national loans, and recent credit event programs. Each type serves specific borrower needs that conventional loans can't address.
        </p>

        <h3>Are non-QM loans safe for borrowers?</h3>
        <p>
          Modern non-QM loans have strong borrower protections and responsible underwriting. They verify ability to repay using alternative documentation methods. They're designed for capable borrowers who don't fit conventional boxes, not subprime lending.
        </p>

        <h3>What credit score do I need for a non-QM loan?</h3>
        <p>
          Credit requirements vary by program and lender. Bank statement loans typically require 620-700+, DSCR loans 660-700+, and asset depletion 680+. Wholesale brokers access lenders at every credit tier to find the best fit.
        </p>
